Curious - how are using HubSpot as of today?  The reason why I ask is - most of my successful customers have been able to use HS to answer questions like:  * How much $$ pipeline does marketing directly contribute to or influence?  * What channels/geos are generating / not generating $$ pipeline?  * How can they use HubSpot to make their sales team more productive? So  the    team spends more time on selling vs. updating CRM.   * How can they forecast pipeline and revenue better in HubSpot?  * How do they consolidate the existing martech/salestech stack to HubSpot  to    make it a single source of truth.  I mean there’s a lot more to it  and a lot more that HubSpot can do - and this kind of success pretty much ties back to  - Is your HubSpot built around your current buyer journey (data model  processes  KPIs  etc.)? And are the revenue teams adapted to it? In fact  we recently helped an Indian fintech company to optimize its HubSpot instance  resulting in a 20% increase in their pipeline. Can I share that case study with you? Thanks
 please add these CMA rates which are prepaid by GF Turkey up to UK port. The freight charge also includes Origin THC of GBP 275 and so in reality the actual charge from GF Turkey to GF UK for freight is GBP 175 x 20ft since the Origin THC is recovered from the Turksih shippers by GF Turkey  as a local charge in Turkey. Hopefully that hasn’t confused matters too much for you. Best regards
Please can you add this quote to the system. Best regards

" I hope this message finds you well. I am pleased to provide an update on our recent transition from ZohoDesk to Freshdesk  focusing on the key components of our migration and some special additions to enhance our operations. *Migration Highlights*:    1. *Department to Group Conversion*: Successfully transitioned 10    departments to 10 groups in Freshdesk  with primary tickets assigned to the    Customer Support group.    2. *Agent Migration*: Transitioned 55 agents with 7 existing agents    identified and seamlessly integrated without duplication.    3. *Accounts and Companies*: Migrated 200 accounts to corresponding    companies in Freshdesk  alongside recognizing and integrating 140 existing    companies.    4. *Contact Migration*: Transferred 2 964 contacts  properly assigned to    their respective companies. Failures occurred due to existing contacts or    missing critical information (mobile  phone  email  or Twitter).    5. *Custom Fields Creation*: Created 90 custom ticket fields that    existed in ZohoDesk to ensure data integrity in Freshdesk.    6. *Ticket Migration*: Migrated 4 543 tickets primarily to the Customer    Support group with Nareshkumar set as the default agent. Tickets with    non-migrated agents were also assigned to Nareshkumar. *Special Additions:*    1. *Imported Tickets View*: A custom view has been created specifically    for Imported Tickets to facilitate easy access and management.    2. *Imported Creation Date Field*: A custom field named 'Imported    Creation Date' is now available for sorting and tracking purposes  allowing    better management of migrated tickets.    3. *Tags for Identification*: Migrated tickets have been tagged with    ""Imported"" along with the specific date of creation to aid in quick    identification and sorting. *Migration Challenges*:    1. Attachments exceeding 20MB were not migrated due to size limitations.    2. Issues were encountered with tickets owned by or threads replied to    by the user ""dawnraj"". Thank you"

 Sanjay and team As you know we have a developed a feature for port alias. For a single port pair  multiple carriers support different UNLOCODE. So the port alias feature hits a respective UNLOCODE ports supported by that particular carrier. The data has been prepared already for this  we would request you to look at it once before we upload into the system because *last time when we uploaded lot of calls were going to the wrong port ( USJAX instead of USHOU ) because of this mapping. * Attaching the mapping below  please have a look and confirm us the mapping so that we shall upload into the system.

Good day For the customer Megaspeed their top requirements has been CMA CGM spot rates. During a call with them today  they informed us that they have been waiting for a CMA CGM spot for more than 1.5 years and now they have started looking for other platforms in the market that provides CMA CGM spot rates. As you informed yesterday  we are aware that we have enabled CMA CGM spot rates for 11 of our customers  which will be increased by day to day. It would be great if we could enable the same for MEGASPEED CARGO as well. Please let me know your thoughts and Kindly do the needful. Looking forward to hearing from you. Thanks and Regards
Good Day!! May I know why MYMSC is inactive for TCI Hamburg?? I see the credentials are working perfectly fine. Please check and update asap. *Thanks & Regards
  The churn beast is raising its head again in a couple of accounts today alone.    One of the single more repetitive reasons from customer complaints are lack of carrier connections. Ie. I sign up to Freightify with 8 credentials but i only see rates from 1-2 carriers. Often  we find that carrier connections are off for various reasons  bugs  expired credentials  user error etc. etc.    Today we need to verify these entirely manually in CS  doing sample checks on each account/carrier combination. This is ineffective and prevents a proactive approach to solving issues before the customer even becomes aware of them.   Is there a way we can automate the above in a dashboard type structure ie. Customer x  has 8 carriers  4 are working RED FLAG..... ? not sure this needs to run daily but maybe twice a week?   Thoughts?   Peter

As CS professionals  we know how much pressure there is for our customer success strategy to have proven ROI  bring real results  and help people achieve their goals. It’s a constant battle to close in on a scalable approach to success that works for all your clients  regardless of niche or type of SaaS. As such there are some set steps to follow for any CS initiative: 1. Segment your customers. Your customers use your product in very specific ways - while some might fit your user persona  some might be outliers and have completely different needs. You need to meet them where they are  and you can use segments to split them based on their company profile  the value they provide  their stage in the customer journey  and more. 2. Perfect your onboarding process. As the official beginning of your customer relationships  you need to pay special attention to onboarding. Poor onboarding can lead to a lot of friction and time wasted down the line. Have a set of things that need to be covered during onboarding  and then decide between a self-service  low-touch  and high-touch approach. 3. Have an overview of each account. Select the things that matter most about a customer for your day-to-day CSM life. Add them to each customer’s account dashboard so you can review them at a glance. This should be you with your customers: donna i know everything suits [ gif i know everything.gif]  4. Actively work to lower churn. Customer churn and revenue churn can kill your business. If you’ve got a 5% monthly churn rate  you’re losing 50% of your customers per year. Monitor churn precursors  improve your support  and be proactive - just a sample of things you can do to reduce churn. 5. Have a set process for renewals. If you want to keep customers  think about retention and loyalty strategies to one up your current process. Mitigate churn risks  offer loyalty rewards  discounts  and be ready to scale. 6. Keep reaching out proactively. Remember that while support is reactive customer success is proactive and you should never get bogged down in daily tasks so much that you neglect proactively chatting with customers. 7. Watch out for upsells and cross-sells. Through automated triggers or by just proactively asking the customer  you might find upsell and cross-sell opportunities. Monitoring and capitalizing on these opportunities is another process you need to smooth out for your CS strategy. 8. Build playbooks and automate. Don’t have time to research the best

"Now  startups and enterprises can enhance their brand engagement by partnering with YourStory and advertising on our YS Buzz and Weekly Wrap newsletters. Click here (  ) to know more. In today's newsletter  we will talk about: Baron Capital slashes BYJU’S valuation Where have all the entry-level tech jobs gone? VC funding crosses $1B mark in May Turning texts into visual designs ICYMI: A tête-à-tête with Zeenat Aman Here’s your trivia for today: Before the early 1980s  the Japanese automaker Nissan was known by what name? Edtech Baron Capital slashes BYJU’S valuation  US-based asset management company Baron Capital Group has reduced the valuation of its stake in edtech firm BYJU'S by 99.85% as of March 31  2024. The decline in Baron Capital's investment value resulted in the venture capital firm sharply cutting the edtech company's valuation to nearly $24 million. Liquidity crunch: Baron Capital  holding 15 334 shares through Baron Emerging Markets Fund and 9 201 shares via Baron Global Advantage Fund  has appraised its investment in BYJU’S at $75 485 and $45 294  respectively. This marks a decrease from its peak valuation of $22 billion in October 2022  aligning with the valuation concern around BYJU’S $200 million rights issue. Meanwhile  BYJU'S has reportedly processed employees' May salaries (  ) from the month's business collections. The company in the past month also raised various debts to bear the salary expense. Read More (  ) From the CapTable Lull in entry-level tech jobs continues; can India’s non-tech sectors compensate?  It’s not the proverbial lull before the storm  but the one after it. Following a pandemic-induced hiring frenzy in 2021 and early 2022  the golden tap of tech jobs has run dry in the last 12-15 months. New employment generated in core tech and engineering sectors hit a two-decade low in FY24  with India’s legacy IT companies drastically cutting down on hiring. Even startups  which absorbed a fair share of tech talent post the VC funding highs of 2021  have tempered their recruitment plans. What’s unfolding is quite the white-collar job crisis. There have been record low levels of placements in the IITs—a story that has been well-documented by now—sending chills down the spine of the country’s education system. “India's fancy education sector is riding on the back of the IT industry. And in the last 20-25 years  the IT industry’s headcount never went down. So  this is a definite problem area  and the next few years will be difficult ” the head of a recruitment agency tells The CapTable. “The question is: How will the volume of jobs be created? Will we be able to create half a million engineering jobs in FY25?” he asks. Key takeaways: Entry-level jobseekers—those with 1-3 years of experience—are finding it challenging to get roles with decent pay packages as recruiters opt for mid-level talent to save on training costs. About 26 lakh entry-level jobseekers (including freshers with no work experience) were looking for active openings in the last 30-day period  per industry estimates. Negative net hiring in the IT sector in FY24  coupled with mass layoffs in Big Tech globally  has led to oversupply of tech talent in the Indian market. Tech attrition is down from 32% two years ago to 7-8% now  with companies lowballing entry-level candidates until they settle for below-par pay. Continue Reading (  ) Funding VC funding crosses $1B mark in May  May turned out to be red hot for the Indian startup ecosystem as venture capital funding rose by 29% annually  crossing the $1 billion mark for the first time this year. The total funding for May was $1.31 billion compared to $1 billion in May 2023  as per data from Yourstory Research. This sharp increase in VC funding can be attributed to the large deals from Meesho and Pharmeasy. Key takeaways: On a month-on-month basis  VC funding rose by 56% with $848 million for April 2024. In terms of stage-wise funding  the late-stage category received the highest amount at $605 million. Early-stage startups attracted $365 million. Healthtech followed by social commerce and fintech sectors were the investor favourites for the month. Read More (  ) Startup Turning texts into visual designs  AI platform Sivi is streamlining design processes. Started by Sona J and Ram Ganeshan in 2019  the Bengaluru-based startup lets users input their message to generate multiple AI-designed options. These designs can be used as-is or fine-tuned manually to enhance the final product. Key takeaways: Sivi's product lets users instantly generate ads  social posts  product banners  profile covers  and more in multiple languages. Unlike other popular AI image generators such as Midjourney or Dall-E  Sivi’s model is trained on design compositions  allowing users to select any object  such as a shape or text  within a design and manipulate it as desired. With its product  Sivi aims to compete with the likes of California-based Canva. Microsoft has also developed a Gen AI model that outputs layered designs  but it is hard to access and available only to researchers. Read More (  ) Interview ICYMI: A tête-à-tête with Zeenat Aman  At 72  Zeenat Aman is defying the myth of ageing and enjoying new-found stardom on social media by connecting to an audience far younger than her. Aman’s Instagram persona is that of a star who is not afraid of straight talk. Whether she’s asking couples to live together before getting married  talking about how her ‘sex symbol’ tag is difficult to shake off  or describing her competitive streak  Aman tells it the way it is—without the need to please everyone. New chapter: Aman’s fans traverse different generations. As she revealed in a recent Instagram post  60% of her followers are between the ages of 25 and 44 years—an audience that has perhaps never seen her in her heydays. Aman doesn’t see herself as someone who can just post pictures of herself or write endless banalities. She is of the view that public figures play a huge role in shaping and guiding conversations—in the living room and on the national stage. Read More (  ) News & Updates Roaring Kitty: (  ) GameStop jumped 21% on Monday after ""Roaring Kitty"" Keith Gill  the stocks influencer behind the 2021 retail trading frenzy  returned to Reddit with a post showing a $116 million bet on the embattled videogame retailer. Splashdown: (  ) SpaceX completed a test flight of its Starship rocket for the first time on Thursday. About an hour after the launch  Starship visibly survived reentry through the Earth’s atmosphere  and the company confirmed that the rocket splashed down in the Indian Ocean to complete the mission. Rates: (  ) The European Central Bank on Thursday confirmed a widely-anticipated reduction in interest rates at its meeting  despite lingering inflationary pressures in the 20-nation eurozone. It takes the central bank’s key rate to 3.75%  down from a record 4% where it has been since September 2023. Did you know?

Philipp here  CEO and Co-Founder of Custify. I often talk about why organizations should implement Customer Success [ . But this week  I want to discuss with you some challenges you might encounter  while implementing such a program.  I know it was very difficult for me when I first started (more than 18 years ago!)  as tools and information weren’t readily available like they are today. However  if I managed to do it  so can you. Below are 3 of the toughest Customer Success challenges  along with possible solutions. Let’s start: 1. Placing the Customer Success team under the right stakeholder Often  I’ve seen Customer Success teams get grouped under the Sales teams. However  SaaS companies can gain a lot more if they pair their CS team with Customer Support. Customer Support handles “break/fix” issues and is always on call. They’re a reactive group. Customer Success  on the other hand  handles customer experience and product adoption. They’re proactive and their main job is to prevent issues from happening. These two teams should complete one another  not merge. Ideally  Customer Success should report directly to the CEO. 2. Lack of customer visibility Being a CSM means being proactive. You need to track your customers daily  to monitor drops in activity  and check for risk of churn. - churn and onboarding problems pile up and you don’t have enough time to dedicate to this task. The more customers you have  the harder this gets no time for games gif [  In the past  this was impossible to accomplish  but modern tools have changed that. You no longer have to wait until a customer brings up a problem. Customer Success Software can notify you in real-time when a customer needs your help. 3. Segmentation Customer segmentation is the core of Customer Success. You might find it strange to put your customers into groups when Customer Success is built on individual personalized outreach  but here’s an example: Not all customers bring in the same amount of money  right? Wouldn’t it be nice if you could prioritize the customers who spend most with you? Here’s a great resource on how you can properly segment your customers. Make sure your segmentation is aligned with your business goals  though otherwise you won’t be able to increase your productivity and revenue. A lot of companies chase too many rabbits from the beginning by creating a custom or really complex segmentation model and can’t implement it. They have too many metrics at their disposal and don’t stay focused on the ones they should track to reach their goals.  As a result  their efforts lose traction because the organization is wasting resources by not focusing on the specific. They run in every direction but end up achieving little. Thankfully  Customer Success Software can also help you with that. Using information from your database you can create detailed customer segments  based on lifecycle stages  churn score  revenue generation potential  behavior  or whatever segmentation works best

The strikes occurred late Saturday  with a ballistic missile hitting the Antigua- and Barbuda-flagged cargo ship Norderney  which sustained a fire that the crew successfully extinguished. A second missile also targeted this ship. Concurrently  the Liberian-flagged  Swiss-operated container ship Tavvishi was hit by a missile  resulting in damage but it remained operational. A second missile aimed at the Tavvishi was intercepted by a coalition warship. Houthi military spokesperson  claimed responsibility for these attacks in a video  asserting that both missiles and drones were used. Despite his claims  there is no confirmed evidence for the additional attacks he mentioned. These maritime assaults are part of over 50 such incidents attributed to the Houthis since November  including three sailor fatalities and the sinking of another ship. The Houthis  involved in a prolonged conflict with a Saudi-led coalition  justify their actions as efforts to halt the ongoing conflict in Gaza and support Palestinians  although many targeted vessels are unrelated to the conflict. This upsurge in maritime violence coincides with increased internal suppression by the Houthis  including the detention of several local UN agency employees and aid workers  and the imposition of death sentences on dozens within Yemen. These actions reflect the group's strained finances and heightened pressure from continued airstrikes by a U.S.-led coalition.

This agreement  signed in 1974  was crucial in maintaining the U.S. dollar's dominance in the global oil market by requiring all Saudi oil sales to be conducted in U.S. dollars. As the deal expired on June 9  2024  Saudi Arabia is now free to conduct oil trades in other major currencies such as the Chinese RMB  Euro  Japanese Yen  and Yuan. This move could lead to a reduction in global reliance on the U.S. dollar and signifies a shift towards more diversified financial transactions  potentially including digital currencies like Bitcoin. This decision aligns with the global trend towards de-dollarization in international trade and reflects a strategic pivot in Saudi economic policy. It also ties into Saudi Arabia's participation in Project mBridge  an initiative that uses distributed ledger technology (DLT) to facilitate instant cross-border payments and settlements. This project  started in 2021 and involving multiple central banks  has recently reached a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) stage  indicating readiness for broader implementation and private sector involvement. Saudi Arabia's move could diminish the US dollar's role in global finance and encourage a more integrated and technologically advanced financial system. This development marks a pivotal moment in international finance  potentially heralding a new era where technological innovation and currency diversification drive economic interactions on the global stage. ——————————————————————————— #### **QUICK CLIPS ON “X”** Tweet:  ( -------------------- ——————————————————————————— #### **SHIPWRECK OF THE WEEK **⚓️☠️[ ]( “Launched in 1939  the **SS American Star**  originally named SS America  was a luxury ocean liner known for its elegant voyages across the Atlantic.

I am writing to formally announce my resignation from my position at Freightify. As you are aware  my current health conditions have become more challenging in recent days. After careful consideration and on the advice of my doctor I have decided to take a break from my job to focus fully on my health. To keep you informed  I am currently under medication and unable to travel due to some operational complexities.

In today's newsletter  we will talk about: Pearson’s roadmap to Indian market The Adani-Ambani payments push Gen AI solutions for developers IoT-enabled solution to tackle pollution A D2C Co serving tea with a twist Here’s your trivia for today: When was the first smartwatch launched? Edtech Pearson’s roadmap to Indian market  Founded in 1844  the UK-headquartered Pearson  a multinational corporation focused on educational publishing and services  has had a complex journey—from being a traditional educational publisher to a digital-first organisation. Pearson’s transformation journey continues to date  as it leverages cutting-edge technologies to personalise education and forge partnerships to expand its offerings and global reach. The company is keen to drive the shift and keep the momentum going across all key markets  including India. Learnings: Pearson ventured into India over 25 years ago  offering textbooks and printed course materials. It also offers test preparation content for competitive exams like JEE  NEET  and UPSC. Earlier in 2024  Pearson partnered with Hyderabad-based Solitaire Business School to offer its BTEC Higher Nationals programmes in business management and courses in sports  fitness instructing and personal training  marketing  and business. It recently joined hands with Chennai-based Veranda Learning  part of Kalpathi AGS Group  to enhance its competitive test preparation and IT education content and resources. Read More (  ) From the CapTable How Ambani and Adani could upend India’s payments status quo  Recently  reports surfaced that ports-to-power conglomerate Adani Group would enter the regulated payments sector. This speculation even forced listed payments entity Paytm to declare to the stock exchanges that reports about its founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma discussing a potential stake sale with the Adanis were untrue. Adani isn’t the only Indian conglomerate making a belated entry into the payments space. Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries has already forayed into the space with Jio Financial Services in 2023. With their vast resources  extensive business networks  and deep understanding of the Indian consumer  these conglomerates have the potential to introduce innovative financial products and services that could attract a substantial user base. Their entry could intensify competition  pushing existing players to enhance their offerings and improve customer service. However  the success of Adani and Ambani in this space is not guaranteed. They  too  must navigate regulatory challenges  establish trust with consumers wary of new financial entrants  and differentiate themselves in a market already dominated by established players such as Google Pay  PhonePe  and Paytm. Key Takeaways: With the Adani Group reportedly set to follow in Reliance’s footsteps and enter payments  the space could be set for upheaval. Apart from being deep-pocketed and well networked  the two conglomerates also enjoy their fair share of policy influence. Both Adani and Reliance wield an extensive array of businesses directly engaged with consumers' spending habits  priming them to become leaders in India's embedded finance landscape.

Planning for unexpected growth sometimes ranks very low on the priority list for a SaaS  but from experience  I can say it’s a frequent issue that can lead to business shutdown. That’s because it’s not just about providing a good level of customer success it’s also about enabling your team to do so  to be efficient and productive at scale. And this is something to cover from the beginning. Thankfully  I’ve thought of 4 steps that will put you on the right track. You can change them  make them better (I’d love to hear about it!)  but you should keep the core of it: Ask: Why do I want customer success? Knowing your goals in customer success is the first step to achieving them. It might sound obvious  but you’d be surprised how many start doing before they finish planning. Think about the following:  * Why do you want customer success in your business?  * What’s the measurable goal you want?  * Why is that the goal and not something else?  * How do you expect the process to go? Define: What’s the role of Customer Success? From an operations standpoint  customer success is a tricky business department. So many of the tasks CS helps with are traditionally the responsibility of other people in an organization. Here’s a sample:  * Onboarding  * Training  * Renewals  * Pre-sales process  * Support Think about which of these fall under the wing of customer success and standardize the roles for your entire business. Unless you start prioritizing an efficient team structure  scaling will always seem like a good dream. Think: What’s the ideal customer experience? Then you need to solve the question of customer experience at scale. What’s the best

"Ahoy Friends !! Another full week in the world of global trade. We have escalating trade tensions in the EV sector  crypto wealth booming and record drug busts. Yep you heard all that correctly. Let’s dive in and take a look! 🔭 **In today’s email:** * **One Two Punch:** 👊🏽 EV market heats up as Europe & US both hit Chinese automakers with tariffs.  * **Money Go Up: **💸 Former Binance CEO’s wealth soars while in prison.  * **Record Haul:** 🚨 Largest cocaine bust in German history valued at €2.6 billion. ---------- ——————————————————————————— #### **TRADE NEWS   ** View image: ( format=auto onerror=redirect quality=80/uploads/asset/file/a92219ae-e1e0-4a0c-95fb-bd3c9e0a2764/Article44.3.jpg?t=1718859887) Caption:  -------------------- ### **Western Tariffs on Chinese EVs Spark Retaliation** The electric vehicle (EV) market has become a focal point for escalating trade tensions between China  the European Union  and the United States. In response to what they perceive as unfair subsidies by Beijing that threaten local industries  the EU has imposed tariffs up to 48% on Chinese EVs. These tariffs follow a detailed anti-subsidy investigation and are intended to protect European jobs while ensuring fair competition in alignment with the EU's green transportation goals. The United States has also dramatically increased its tariffs on Chinese EV imports  raising them from 25% to 100% to bolster American manufacturing and reduce reliance on Chinese goods. Amidst these international disputes  Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has [reduced its holdings in BYD](  a leading Chinese EV manufacturer  by selling 1.35 million shares  which lowered its stake to 6.9%. This reduction is part of a larger trend that began in August 2022  suggesting a strategic re-evaluation in the context of the ongoing trade tensions. China has retaliated against these measures by initiating an anti-dumping investigation into [pork imports]( from the EU. This move is part of a broader strategy to counteract the trade measures it views as targeting its dominant position in the global EV market. Beijing's actions indicate its readiness to extend the trade conflict to other crucial economic sectors  reflecting the complexities of global trade where economic actions in one sector can have broad-reaching impacts. -------------------- ——————————————————————————— ### The Daily Newsletter for Intellectually Curious Readers View image: ( format=auto onerror=redirect quality=80/uploads/asset/file/b58a0446-83d9-4fc1-9d41-77b9932a56f9/02b522900c4ea44e4d1ea3090c3b4390.jpg?t=1715814841) Follow image link: ( Caption:  * We scour 100+ sources daily * Read by CEOs  scientists  business owners and more * 3.5 million subscribers [Sign up today!]( ——————————————————————————— #### **VIDEO OF THE WEEK** View image: ( format=auto onerror=redirect quality=80/uploads/asset/file/aa01f7e0-f197-4894-8f4c-d3e90da14cbb/Video-44.3.jpg?t=1718877097) Follow image link: ( Caption:  ### **Binance Billionaire’s Net Worth Has Soared While Serving Sentence** Prison has been good to Binance founder Changpeng Zhao.

The extensive crackdown resulted in the arrest of seven individuals  disrupting a major international drug trafficking network. The operation came to light following critical intelligence from Colombian officials  leading to the confiscation of 35.5 metric tons (39 US tons) of cocaine. The drugs  concealed among fresh produce in container ships  were distributed across major European ports. Germany's Hamburg port accounted for 25 tons  while Rotterdam seized another 8 tons  and nearly 3 tons were intercepted within Colombia itself. This operation not only highlights the covert sophistication of drug smuggling but also the robust response by international law enforcement. The culprits  a diverse group of German  Azerbaijani  Bulgarian  Moroccan  Turkish  and Ukrainian nationals aged between 30 to 54  were systematically detained over recent weeks. A local businessman from North Rhine-Westphalia was notably implicated for setting up around 100 shell companies to mask these illegal operations under the guise of legitimate business. Further adding to this high-stakes operation  German forces arrested three individuals suspected of facilitating the transfer of sensitive technological knowledge to China  intensifying the crackdown on illegal activities. This monumental bust  described by North Rhine-Westphalia's justice minister  Benjamin Limbach  as a ""precise punch in the jaw"" to organized crime  marks a significant victory in the fight against global narcotics trafficking.

Its been a few months since we are trying to make full use of the subscription. However we are finding it difficult to move ahead and get user acceptance. You would agree that getting incorrect or incomplete rates will eventually lead to losses for us. The users are always having to cross check authenticity of the rates this is actually defeating the purpose of having a tool that is supposed to ensure that a user does not have to log on to multiple carrier websites. In these challenging times authenticity and timeliness of information is of utmost importance. We hope that all these issues will be resolved on priority and we would appreciate a timeline. Thank you

Now  startups and enterprises can enhance their brand engagement by partnering with YourStory and advertising on our YS Buzz and Weekly Wrap newsletters. Click here (  ) to know more. In today's newsletter  we will talk about: Seafund’s deeptech bets grow bigger The trouble brewing at Third Wave Coffee India’s CTO Excellence Awards winners Financial literacy for rural women Mira Kapoor on launching Akind Here’s your trivia for today: In August of 1997  Microsoft bailed what technology company out of bankruptcy? Venture capital Seafund’s deeptech bets grow bigger  Bengaluru-based early-stage venture capital (VC) firm Seafund Venture Capital is now cutting larger cheques for startups that have technology depth. Founded in 2015 by Manoj Kumar Agarwal and Mayuresh Raut  Seafund came out with its first fund of Rs 25 crore around 2018  and is now looking to close its second fund of Rs 250 crore by the end of this year. The playbook: The VC firm’s Rs 250 crore (around $30 million) Fund II is a split between Rs 200 crore primary money and another Rs 50 crore greenshoe option. While it used to invest around $100 000 as initial capital in startups  and then with follow-on rounds in the first fund  it now plans to invest around $500 000 in the first round of funding and follow it up with more than $1 million in subsequent rounds in the second fund. One of Seafund’s first investments was in Wigzo  a tech startup that focused on customer engagement and retention. Seafund exited this startup after it was acquired by Shiprocket in 2022. Read More (  ) From the CapTable A storm in a coffee cup at Third Wave Coffee  On the evening of December 12  2023  employees at Bengaluru-based specialty coffee chain Third Wave Coffee Roasters panicked when the company announced internally that it was eliminating several positions. The news was a bolt from the blue since the company had raised $35 million in funding just three months prior and was rapidly expanding. While employees across departments such as tech  branding  and marketing were surprised by the layoffs  those in finance were not. Nearly 70% of the company’s stores were losing money every day and there was a push towards turning them profitable  a former employee working in the finance department told The CapTable. Another indication of Third Wave’s struggles was the departure of Shrikant Sharma  the company’s director of finance  who stepped down just two months after the $35 million fundraise. According to an investor closely associated with Third Wave  Sharma was asked to step down due to differences with the company’s founders. “There’s chaos within the firm. The founders have very little say in operations  and it is Sujeet Kumar (co-founder of Udaan and an angel investor) calling all the shots  along with WestBridge Capital. The company has less than a year’s runway left and Sujeet and the management will have to do something major to script a turnaround ” the investor said. Key Takeaways: Udaan co-founder Sujeet Kumar  with the support of WestBridge Capital  has been calling the shots at coffee retail chain Third Wave Coffee. Other investors have little say in the company’s operations. Kumar first invested a small cheque in Third Wave in 2018. He is now the largest individual shareholder after the three founders  holding a 6% stake. Third Wave had three months of runway left last year when it raised funds in a Creagis-led round. Today it has less than a year’s runway left thanks

We have received below feedback from Kopf Luebben. They are very much disappointed with our rate sheet conversions as there are many delays in processing the file. I request you to instruct the concern team to work all the files within the agreed SLA and make sure there are no mistakes. Below mail for your reference. Please check the submitted status file immediately and update me. *Quote:* I’m sorry to ask you for your assistance once again. Despite of some issues with local charges (especially for the rates out of Europe)  I noticed also for our rates delayed updates. Even for rates we are already had in our system. We have 3 days and as you can see 1 week old: As you can see  this following updates are live. For this rate I just received an update. So I need to delete this version and will upload the new one. I’m sure you will understand how important fast and complete updates are. We have no doubt you and your colleagues do have the same goal. *Unquote:* *Thanks & Regards

I’ve said this before  and I’ll say it again: Customer Success Managers are not Account Managers! [  There’s a fundamental difference between the two roles - Account Managers are reactive  while Customer Success Managers are proactive.  And this proactivity also extends into how you approach your role in your organization  not only how you interact with customers. This means that you shouldn’t limit your daily tasks to the ones defined in your job description. Here are 3 responsibilities you’re probably not aware of  but that your organization expects you to complete: 1. Building relationships between customers and the support team Here’s something I see a lot: especially in smaller companies  customer success and customer support tend to overlap and are used interchangeably. In the sense that Management decides they want a CS department and just end up renaming part of the Customer Support department. Segmenting the responsibilities of the success and support functions  so autonomy lines and collaboration are clear is no easy task. But in the end  it’s all about keeping your team as efficient and effective as possible. which one of you was it [  Here’s how I see it: any technical issues (like crashes) or minor product problems (UI problems  for example) that are not your responsibility should be geared towards the Customer Support Team.  However  it’s your job to oversee the relationship between your customers and the Support Department and ensure quick and easy issue resolution. After all  customer success is about optimizing customer journeys  not just touchpoints  and timely responses lead to happy customers  in the long run. 2. Advocating customers’ needs As a CSM  you work directly with customers. This means you should actively advocate their needs. If they request a certain feature  or if they say that the interface is not intuitive enough  it’s your job to make sure the other teams take notice of this feedback and adapt. A few years ago  I was working with a SaaS business that was just creating its own Customer Success department. They were in their early stages  with only 2 people managing their customer portfolio. I noticed that their customers had some really great ideas and insights about the direction the product should go towards  so I helped them implement a product roadmap where customers could submit and vote on new features. That way the customers felt heard and acknowledged  while the team worked on features that were actually relevant and necessary. As a CSM  you can organize  analyze  and share information with the other departments to ensure your organization considers and reflects the voices and needs of your customers. 3. Generating and sharing educational resources  training and best

Verghese warned that the protectionist measures are significantly exacerbating food inflation  creating a severe demand-supply imbalance. Verghese starkly noted  ""We have fought many wars over oil. We will fight bigger wars over food and water."" This assertion underlines the growing global tensions as countries scramble to secure food resources amidst escalating climate challenges and geopolitical conflicts. In 2022  following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine  1 266 non-tariff barriers were established by 154 countries  tightening the global exchange of essential commodities like grains and fertilizers  thus inflating prices and intensifying a global cost-of-living crisis. Wealthier nations have been building up excess stocks  contributing to the spiraling prices that have deepened food insecurities in poorer regions. This scarcity has been further aggravated by climate impacts on agriculture  leading to sharp increases in prices for key commodities such as cocoa  coffee  and sugar. In response  countries like Indonesia and India have imposed export restrictions to stabilize domestic markets  moves Verghese criticized as counterproductive. Highlighting the necessity for proactive measures  Verghese urged industry leaders to address climate risks seriously and advocated for governments to implement carbon taxes to mitigate indiscriminate pollution. His comments reflect a pressing call to action as global stability hangs in the balance with the looming threat of food wars.[ ]( -------------------- ——————————————————————————— ### Get value stock insights free.

Now  startups and enterprises can enhance their brand engagement by partnering with YourStory and advertising on our YS Buzz and Weekly Wrap newsletters. Click here (  ) to know more. In today's newsletter  we will talk about: Prosus zeroes out BYJU’S stake Private credit  public concerns Expanding access to affordable education Robotic solutions for urban water sanitation A spirit that transcends borders Here’s your trivia for today: What is the coldest place in the universe? Investments Prosus zeroes out BYJU’S stake  Prosus  BYJU'S' largest institutional shareholder  has written off its entire investment in the once high-flying edtech startup  which sought new funding at a 99% discounted valuation through a rights issue earlier this year. The Netherlands-based investment conglomerate  owned by South Africa’s Naspers  has invested $578 million in BYJU'S so far  with nearly $400 million coming from its first investment round in 2018. It held an over 10% stake until mid-2022. Investment outlook: Prosus wrote off the fair value of its 9.6% effective interest in BYJU'S and recognised a fair value loss of $493 million in other comprehensive income in the current year  the company said in its annual report. Prosus said the write-down was primarily because it has inadequate information on BYJU’S’ financial health  liabilities  and future outlook. Meanwhile  the investment group maintained a strong outlook on IPO-bound food delivery platform Swiggy (  )   citing improvement in operational leverage  and reported appreciating investments in Meesho  ElasticRun  and Urban Company. Read More (  ) From the CapTable The not-so private worries with India’s expanding private credit market  In recent years  private credit funds  which offer higher returns than their public debt counterparts  have become an increasingly popular investment avenue not just in India  but globally. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) defines private credit as “non-bank corporate credit provided through bilateral agreements or small ‘club deals’.” In April 2024  the IMF’s Global Financial Stability Report (  ) noted that the private credit market  driven by specialised non-bank financial institutions  had surpassed $2.1 trillion in assets. These instruments  characterised by loans and debt financing provided outside traditional banking channels  have seen exponential growth in India as well. Data published by markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India  or Sebi  shows that nine private credit funds announced new fund raises aggregating more than $2 billion in the second half of 2023 alone. Industry forecasts predict that private credit assets under management (AUM) in India will reach $60-70 billion by 2028. Despite their growing popularity  though  it’s worth asking whether the public markets would assign high valuations to private credit funds should they queue up for an IPO  especially given the opaque nature of their operations. The assumption that higher returns for investors can be achieved by averaging overall portfolio performance  despite occasional credit mishaps and write-offs  is flawed. The private credit market is neither new nor innovative. It is merely a repackaging of one of the oldest financial products in history—the unlicensed local money merchants. Key Takeaways: Private credit is an increasingly popular investment segment  not just in India but globally In India  nine private credit funds announced new fund raises totalling more than $2 billion in the second half of 2023 The rising popularity of private credit among investors can be attributed to the fact they offer higher returns than their public debt counterparts However  their opacity coupled with a lack of regulatory oversight is cause for serious concern Continue Reading (  ) Startup Expanding access to affordable education  Varthana provides loans to small private schools that lack existing banking relationships but need the money for activities like expanding classrooms  constructing or upgrading labs  or buying school buses. “Most banks avoid underwriting loans for such schools due to preconceived notions about their creditworthiness and the challenges involved in the underwriting process ” explains Co-founder Steve Hardgrave.

Tech solutions: Cleaning septic tanks is just one of the problems in urban water sanitation management  according to Kumar. Water and sanitation are interconnected  and all its assets  from pipelines to drainage systems  are underground. Solinas Integrity built robotic solutions like HomeSep  India’s first septic tank and manhole cleaning robot and EndoBot—an “endoscopy” kind of robot for inspecting all kinds of pipelines. It also launched Swasth  a digital AI dashboard for assessment and data management of pipeline conditions. Solinas has deployed its solutions in over 15 cities in nine states.

Being a C-level / VP- level executive is tough  so this must have gotten lost.  I thought it makes more sense for me to give you a no-fluff context about how I helped a company fix their leaky cold-calling process - that improved meeting conversions by 15%.  We also fixed their calling tool <> HS integration - resulted in better visibility that enabled better target setting >> resulted in 30% increase in calling volumes Lastly  we automated their lead routing and follow up scheduling - leading to a 20% boost in middle funnel lead management KPIs. Mind if I share the case study?  Attaching it here would be easier  I know - but then this email wouldn't have reached you. :D (lemme know if you wish to know more about this too ;))   On Mon  May 27  2024 at 08:34 AM UTC Jatin Chhabra <jatin@growtomation.co.in [jatin@growtomation.co.in]> wrote: >  >  > Curious - how are using HubSpot as of today?  >  >  > The reason why I ask is - most of my successful customers have been able to > use HS to answer questions like: >  * How much $$ pipeline does marketing directly contribute to or influence? >  * What channels/geos are generating / not generating $$ pipeline? >  * How can they use HubSpot to make their sales team more productive?

Do you know how much value you bring to your organization? What is Customer Success worth to you? Most companies that invest in Customer Success have no idea what the actual ROI of their CSMs is  nor what ratio of CSM to customers is optimal for their business. But having this information is crucial  even though no one seems to know how to measure it. To calculate the ROI of an employee  you need to know:  1. How much you spend for that employee - usually Cost = Salary + Overhead +     Tooling + Expenses  2. The baseline status without that employee  3. The impact directly attributed to that employee So the ROI of an employee is = (Revenue generated - baseline) / (Fully loaded cost) Now  the confusion arises because no one knows the baseline of a CSM  nor how to calculate their attributable impact. Why? Because to calculate a reliable baseline  you need to run an A/B test on a group of very similar customers that don’t have access to a CSM. And this group needs to be large enough to be statistically significant. If you only assign CSMs to your top tier customers  you might think to use the net retention rate of your lower tier customers (who don’t have access to a CSM) as a baseline. But churn rates differ drastically depending on the Average Revenue Per Account (ARPA)  so you can’t draw a statistically accurate conclusion.  That’s why measuring the ROI of a CSM is hard. You can’t deny that they have an impact  but you can’t quantify it easily. Mostly because a portion of that impact is intangible and many factors outside a CSM’s control affect their metrics. It’s not all bad news  though. A Customer Success Software tool can help you scale  optimize  and track results from your CS team  as a whole and on an individual basis. I’ve gone into more detail on how you can calculate the ROI of your CSMs yourself in this article [ . I shared everything you should consider when calculating how much a CSM is worth to your business and how we do it here at Custify. Always happy to share CS knowledge with you Philipp [ wolf round small.png]  As the CEO of Custify  Philipp Wolf helps SaaS businesses deliver great results for customers. After seeing companies spend big money with no systematic approach to customer success  Philipp knew something had to change.

Now  startups and enterprises can enhance their brand engagement by partnering with YourStory and advertising on our YS Buzz and Weekly Wrap newsletters. Click here (  ) to know more. In today's newsletter  we will talk about: A clash of retail and e-pharmacies The curious case of Byju's second rights issue. Trouble brewing at ReshaMandi VC funding’s big comeback Sustainable travel companions Here’s your trivia for today: Which player took the most wickets in T20 World Cup tournaments? Explainer A clash of retail and e-pharmacies  On June 25  the Madras High Court overturned an earlier November 2018 ruling by a single-judge bench that restricted online pharmacies from delivering medicines to customers. This decision is just the latest chapter of a long legal back and forth between conventional and online pharmacies. But why are brick-and-mortar and online pharmacies at odds with each other? A legal rollercoaster: The overturned ruling followed a plea from the Chennai-based Tamil Nadu Chemists and Druggists Association that placed an interim injunction restraining online sales of medicines  highlighting concerns about unfair discounts  unlicensed and unregulated drugs  counterfeiting concerns and data privacy risks. The association also stated that permitting the sale of drugs online defeats the purpose of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act  of 1940 which regulated the manufacture and sale of drugs under prescribed storage conditions by qualified pharmacists. More people are opting for online pharmacies  owing to greater convenience for those in remote areas or those unable to visit physical stores  transparent tracking systems and easy-to-access prescription records. Read More (  ) From the CapTable The curious case of Byju’s second rights issue  In January  beleaguered edtech Byju’s made a last-ditch effort to stay afloat. With its cash reserves running out  the Bengaluru-based company—once India’s most valuable startup—launched a rights issue to raise $200 million at a 99% discount to its last valuation of $22 billion. While Byju’s claimed the rights issue was fully subscribed  its hopes were dashed when many of its investors—including Prosus  General Atlantic  Peak XV Partners  and Sofina Ventures—refused to participate  stating they would only invest further if the management of Byju’s was changed. Their opposition saw the proceeds of the rights issues locked away in an escrow account while the National Company Law Tribunal  or NCLT  adjudicated the matter. On the evening of June 13 when the Bengaluru bench of the NCLT convened for the latest hearing of the case  things got even murkier. Byju’s was accused of covertly launching a second rights issue even as its first remained in limbo. With Byju’s largest shareholders having lost faith in the leadership of the company’s founder  Byju Raveendran  raising more funds through a second rights issue was never going to be easy. Especially with the first rights issue still sub judice. This time around  investors allege that the company did not comply with the procedures required by the Companies Act. Continue Reading (  ) Employees Trouble brewing at ReshaMandi  B2B startup ReshaMandi raised $5.6 million in a Series A funding round led by Creation Investments and Omnivore in June 2023 at a valuation of $74 million—the same month it informed its employees of salary delays. Former employees allege that management told them salary payments would be delayed for three months. However  what followed was not pay regularisation  but the first of many rounds of layoffs. A tale of two startups: Founded in May 2020 by Mayank Tiwari and ex-Cisco employee Saurabh Agarwal  ReshaMandi is a B2B silk agritech startup that links farmers to consumers. The farmers sell yarn to the company  which is then sold at the marketplace  with ReshaMandi pocketing a margin of the sale. Some employees were asked by the startup to join a new Noida-based entity called Genzr  for similar job profiles  offer letters reveal. These employees claim they were also promised that any remaining salary dues would be paid in the form of a joining bonus if they signed the letter. Employees say administrative mismanagement and incorrectly handled processes are hurting future prospects  including leaving some unable to access their provident fund accounts because of a botch-up related to their exit dates by the ReshaMandi HR team. Read More (  ) Funding VC funding’s big comeback  In the first six months of 2024  venture capital (VC) funding into Indian startups showed all the signs of a steady upward trajectory  as it rose by 45% compared to the preceding six months between July and December 2023. Indian startups raised a total of $6.4 billion in VC funding in the first six months of 2024. In contrast  they secured $4.4 billion in the second half of 2023  according to YourStory Research. Steady recovery: The last two months—May and June—saw VC funding crossing $1 billion  an important benchmark for the ecosystem and an indication that this year’s funding will likely surpass the $10.8 billion figure in 2023. The first six months of 2024 saw a total of 665 deals  but only eight deals exceeded the total value of $100 million. Fewer large-value deals are the primary reason for VC funding continuing to remain at a modest level. Given the present funding winter scenario  such high-value deals have become few and far between. Read More (  ) Startup Sustainable travel companions  The luggage market is pegged at about Rs 50 000 crore in India. The sector is dominated by a few players and is utility-driven. Customers care for good quality  smart-looking luggage. Mumbai-based Uppercase knows this  which is why it is making stylish yet durable luggage. Sustainability is an added advantage. Reducing waste: Uppercase differentiates itself with its hard-backed polycarbonate luggage manufactured using a combination of virgin polycarbonate and recycled polycarbonate. The company raised $1.5 million in a seed round from Emam Holdings in March 2022  followed by $7 million in a pre-Series A round led by Sixth Sense India Opportunities III later in July 2022. The company currently manufactures 30 000 units of hard luggage per month and plans to raise production up to 60 000 to 75 000 units per month. Read More (  ) News & Updates Bumper year: (  ) Qatar Airways posted a 39% jump in annual net profit to a record 6.1 billion Qatari riyals ($1.67 billion) on Tuesday. The Qatar government-owned airline said its revenue grew by 6% to 81 billion riyals in the year ended March 31. Long week: (  ) Greece has controversially introduced a six-day working week for some businesses to boost productivity and employment in the southern European country. The regulation  which came into force on July 1  bucks a global trend of companies exploring a shorter working week. For sale: (  ) The ownership group that controls the NBA champion Boston Celtics says it intends to sell all its shares of the team. In a statement  Boston Basketball Partners LLC said it intends to sell a majority of its shares in 2024 or early 2025. The balance of its shares would then close in 2028. Did you know?

Through the years  I’ve seen many SaaS businesses trying to come up with a definite answer to the question “how many accounts should a CSM handle”. And I’ve heard answers like “37 on the low end  200 on the high end” or “1 CSM per $2M/ARR”. Well today  I want to bust those myths.  ghost busters gif [  The $-per-CSM model is a direct carry-over from traditional Account Management. But since CSMs are not Account Managers [  obviously the number of accounts they should be assigned to should also be calculated differently. If you’re looking for a formula to determine how many CSMs per Customer or per Dollar of Revenue you should have  you’re out of luck: there isn’t one. That’s because the number is unique to your situation.  So how can you figure out how many accounts a CSM should handle? The vital input you should consider is how much TIME can a CSM actually spend with customers? Depending on your answer  you can determine the number of accounts a CSM can manage  as well as how many CSMs you need to hire. To calculate this  start by segmenting your customer base and determining the coverage level and the required type of coverage necessary for each segment (from your customers’ point of view). For example  if one segment requires a high-touch  consultative experience  then fewer accounts can be assigned to a CSM. On the other hand  if most of the communication can be automated  then CSMs can handle a higher volume of accounts. If you already have a CS team in place  you can extract a baseline by exporting CRM and calendar reports from the past 12 months. With a bit of data crunching you find out how much time each CSM spends with a customer. For some customers  it might be as high as 20 hours a week. For others  it might be 2. If you segment your clients correctly  there should be minimal differences between segments. Here are the customer profiles that tend to require the most time:  * new customers;  * low maturity;  * bottom quintile ARR. For them  you should aim to automate the CS tasks as much as possible so your team can focus on high-potential clients. Figure out where most of the time is spent now and use Customer Success software to optimize. So tell me honestly  how do YOU determine your Customer Success practitioner coverage ratios? Are you using any of the methods I’ve described above? Cheers Philipp [ wolf round small.png]  As the CEO of Custify  Philipp Wolf helps SaaS businesses deliver great results for customers.

Please find below feedback from customer Blue Freight Service. Can you please check and provide me the insights of the tickets generated by this customer? *Quote:* Please check attached EMail. This is a huge concern for our use of freightify. In short: Freightify is showing rates of Maersk which we can’t book in our Maersk log in. The Spot vessels shown in freightify are not available in the Maersk Log in. Furthermore on Maersk we have a difference of 500 USD of the basic O/F for this case (Hamburg King Abdullah). I am sure that your service team is checking everything carefully and have issues to recreate the errors accruing. Please understand that most of my reported bugs end like this: “We can’t find the error on our side  please report again”. This is not very helpful nor growing my trust into the tool. Just to be clear I offered the set up I got via freightify the customer and they booked. This would have caused a huge loss on this shipment. We were able to find a different solution not via freightify. Which is interesting because we found it via the MSC tool which is also connected to the system. I hope you understand that the statement: “We couldn’t find the bug please report next time again” is not enough if we are loosing our profit. Are those bugs being escalated? For me it seams this case is closed and nobody will car anymore. And next when I report the same bug the service team will behave the same way?! Please let me know how those things will be taken care on. Because I have the feeling those thing will just be forgotten. *Unquote:* *Thanks & Regards

This 17 859 TEU vessel  built in 2005  was en route from Asia to Europe when it encountered the rough conditions on July 9. In addition to the containers lost overboard  another 30 were damaged onboard. Thankfully  there were no injuries to the crew  no pollution  and no damage to the vessel itself  which remains seaworthy. The lost containers were carrying non-hazardous goods  so there’s no risk of dangerous cargo at sea. CMA CGM promptly informed the authorities and headed to Cape Town for a thorough inspection to ensure the ship’s safe continuation of its journey. The [bad weather in Cape Town]( has been relentless this week. Strong winds have damaged nearly 1 000 homes in informal settlements  displacing around 4 000 people. South African weather officials predict these conditions will last until Friday  bringing more strong winds  heavy rain  flooding  and mudslides. The CMA CGM Benjamin Franklin isn’t the only vessel affected. On Monday  the Ultrabulk-managed Ultra Galaxy listed near South Africa. Its 18-strong crew was safely rescued after evacuating in a life raft. Today  reports indicate the vessel ran aground off Brand se Baai  385km north of Cape Town  and efforts are underway to prevent a fuel and oil spill. -------------------- ——————————————————————————— #### ** TOGETHER WITH THEOTRADE** ### Transform Your Trading: Join TheoTrade and Gain Free Masterclass Access Imagine a space where profitable trading ideas flow freely every day  shared among thousands of traders by seasoned professionals… No need to imagine any longer… Welcome to [TheoTrade]( – a groundbreaking community where expert traders guide both experienced and novice traders through the complexities of the stock market.

"In today's newsletter  we will talk about: Budget checklist for online gaming startups Jio vs Airtel: The race to monetise 5G with fixed wireless access Drone sector’s Budget wishlist Eco-friendly choices made easy Planning tourism’s Budget itinerary Here’s your trivia for today: An ""octothorpe"" refers to which popular social media symbol? In-depth Budget checklist for online gaming startups  The online gaming industry in India has seen a rapid expansion mirroring the rise in digital reach across the country  the adoption and rise of the 5G network  and pandemic-induced change in user consumption patterns. According to an EY report  India had about 455 million gamers in 2023. The industry is now hoping for a boost from the upcoming Budget to be presented on July 23 as high taxes threaten to stagger growth. Level up: The government has deployed some measures to encourage game development in India by allowing 100% FDI into the sector and the inclusion of esports as part of multi-sports events. Earlier this month  70 online gaming and esports companies drafted a recommendation letter to the newly formed government with 10 policies to help the sector. The companies requested the government to tap into GST rationalisation  suggesting video games be moved from the 18% tax bracket to 12%. Read More (  ) From the CapTable Jio vs Airtel: The race to monetise 5G with fixed wireless access  In 2022  India’s telecom titans Reliance Jio Infocomm and Bharti Airtel spent big on acquiring fifth-generation  or 5G  spectrum. Combined  the duo spent close to $20 billion. They sank another few billion into procuring telecom equipment from vendors such as Ericsson and Nokia to roll out 5G-capable networks. For all the money it entailed  though  setting up their 5G plays was the easy part. Now comes the hard part—recouping their massive outlays. The two companies are now racing to recover their 5G investments by offering 5G fixed wireless access (FWA) to millions of home subscribers looking for home broadband internet connections. While Airtel was first to launch its 5G FWA offering  Xstream AirFiber  last August in Delhi and Mumbai  Jio’s service—JioAirFiber—was unleashed the following month in 8 cities  including all major Indian metros. Now  both telcos are ramping up the availability of 5G FWA on a war footing. Key takeaways: Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel have sunk billions into rolling out extensive 5G networks. Now  the race is on to monetise them. After the recent tariff hikes  the next battle ground for the telcos appears to be fixed wireless access broadband. Both companies are aggressively expanding fixed wireless broadband coverage  with Airtel preparing to extend its coverage to hundred of cities pan-India. Jio  meanwhile  which boasts a far larger 5G network  already offers services in over 7 500 cities and towns and is aggressively moving to increase its broadband lead over Airtel. Continue Reading (  ) Union Budget Drone sector’s Budget wishlist  India's drone sector is raring to go. It has everything going for it—rapid innovation fuelled by startups  strategic investments  and a supportive government framework. Many analysts YourStory talked to agreed that the upcoming Budget for FY25 needs to include pro-technology policies that promote growth by investing in digital infrastructure  supporting businesses and startups  and encouraging emerging tech sector investment. Take off: The National Deep Tech Startup Policy (NDTSP) is a significant step towards fostering innovation and economic growth in the drone sector. The central government launched the Drone Didi scheme in November 2023 to empower women in self-help groups and agriculture by training them as drone pilots for agricultural tasks. The initiative provides agricultural drones to 15 000 women-led self-help groups to generate extra income opportunities. Establishing dedicated testing facilities and expanding schemes like the Drone Didi Yojana will further empower rural agri-entrepreneurs and foster inclusive economic development through drone technology  says Prem Kumar Vislawath  CEO and Founder of Marut Drones. Read More (  ) Sustainability Eco-friendly choices made easy  Impacto is a marketplace for sustainable products across categories like fashion  beauty  and wellness products. It serves individual customers and the B2B segment  and supplies to multinational companies  hotels  and large institutions. Founder Shivang Singh says the platform is a “conscious movement towards eco-friendly choices”. Go green: Impacto provides recycled notebooks  bamboo-based toiletries such as tissues  kitchen rolls and wipes  compostable and disposable tableware  and eco-friendly gift hampers to schools  restaurants  hotels  and companies. The brand earns revenue by charging a 30% commission on sales in the B2C space. For B2B  Impacto purchases the required number of products from the brand and then sells them at a higher price. It is now moving towards the business-to-government (B2G) sector  where it is working with the Delhi government. Read More (  ) Union Budget Planning tourism’s Budget itinerary  Post the COVID-19 pandemic  the travel and tourism sectors have undergone an evolution. Travel-related digital platforms  visa-free international destinations and the rise of staycations have seen an uptick among Indian travellers. Against this rapidly changing backdrop  hospitality sector stakeholders are holding a series of expectations from this year’s Budget: industry status for tourism  a reduced GST rate  and funding and enhanced technologies for airport infrastructure  among others. Travel checklist: A sustained focus on improving road  rail  and air connectivity has boosted local tourism and seen the emergence of new tourist places  especially in rural and semi-urban India. Last month  Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Associations of India President Pradeep Shetty discussed Budget expectations with Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman  including granting infrastructure status for hotels across categories. FHRAI also recommended a 12% GST rate across all hotels. EaseMyTrip Co-founder Nishant Pitti also expects the upcoming Budget to invest in airport expansions  new air routes  and improved connectivity to boost domestic tourism and job creation and attract international tourists. Read More (  ) News & Updates Inflation: (  ) India's retail inflation rate rose for the first time in five months in June due to a sharp rise in food prices. Annual retail inflation was 5.08% in June  up from 4.75% in May. Food prices rose 9.36% from last year in June compared to an 8.69% rise in May. Theft: (  ) US phone giant AT&T will begin notifying millions of consumers about a fresh data breach that allowed cybercriminals to steal the phone records of “nearly all” of its customers. The stolen data contains phone numbers and AT&T records of calls and text messages between May 1  2022  and October 31  2022. Intervention: (  ) Japan likely stepped into currency markets for a third time this year to prop up the yen soon after US inflation figures came out Thursday. The scale of intervention was probably around $22 billion  based on a comparison of Bank of Japan accounts and money broker forecasts. Did you know?

Recently  I’ve taken a long hard look at the “aha” moment. No  I’m not talking about the Norwegian synth-pop band. I’m talking about the customer journey moment that makes them understand the true value your product can bring. aha take on me gif [ take on me gif.gif]  What I’ve found is: First  the majority of customers churn before they get a chance to understand what your product does for them. Second  if your product is good  the a-ha moment happens as soon as they see your product. They don’t have to go looking around for it. So why are so many businesses getting this wrong? Research from Kissmetrics found that by improving the first 5 minutes of a customer’s interaction with your product  you’re driving that customer’s lifetime value up by 50%. Likewise  if your first 5 minutes are bad  the odds of that customer returning to do business with you fall significantly. This leads me to another point: Third  a CSM’s relationship with a new customer is extremely fragile. That user will go away at the first sign of trouble. You need to take on the responsibility for that. Be calculated and deliberate in your approach  without falling into the trap of anxiety:  1. Set relevant goals throughout the consumer onboarding process. You need to     have clearly-defined expectations for your customers  otherwise  you’re     getting false metrics and that can only lead to bad decision-making.  2. Measure those goals correctly (very important!). It’s very easy to make     mistakes when measuring one goal or another. Get a specialist to help you     set up  track  and optimize those goals if you’re just starting.  3. Proactively reach out if those goals aren’t met. Now - you can do this with     automation in just a few steps (you can check out our website for more)  but     the point is to make it clear that you know they’re struggling. Say  we noticed you haven’t quite figured it out yet. Tell     us what you want to do in a reply to this email  or check out our knowledge     base section!”  4. Fix what isn’t working. Say 10 customers have the same issue  they stop at     the same point during the customer journey  or churn at the same step every     time - that’s a red flag that you need to go in and do something ASAP. And     even better  take a note from change management theories and tell your     customers what you’ve done.  5. Write back again. No matter what happens after you first reach out  do it     again! You can either thank them for sticking with you  apologize for not     fixing a problem in time  thank them for helping you fix something  or     congratulate them on completing their onboarding. Every little interaction     helps with the customer relationship. That’s basically what I’ve been up to lately. What about you? How do you make sure your customers have that Aha Moment? I’m open to hear your take - just hit reply! Hope you’re having a wonderful time Philipp [ wolf round small.png]  As the CEO of Custify  Philipp Wolf helps SaaS businesses deliver great results for customers.

As discussed  positioning exercise to be considered as an integral part of the point system as much as the case studies and testimonials are considered. Please communicate this to the champions as I see  they aren't agreeing to proceed with the same. We'd be considering positioning exercises for the key accounts only going forward.

As a CSM  you never know when someone important might put you on the spot. Once  Arit Nsemo ( ) was in an internal meeting with several of her company’s senior leaders  presenting ideas for how to get customers faster time to value ( ) and unlock more expansion opportunities. As Arit writes on the Vitally blog ( ?) : “During the meeting  our CEO asked me what my retention rate was for my book of business and I couldn’t answer the question. I fumbled for a minute and then admitted that I didn’t know. I was so embarrassed  and it warranted a coaching moment from my boss at the time. “I’d fallen into the trap of letting Revenue Operations and Finance teams calculate my numbers  and only thought of it in service to my quarterly bonus payout. It was a mistake I would not repeat.” Since then  Arit has identified four things that all CSMs should have in their back pocket at all times  and not just so they can avoid embarrassment. From MRR/ARR in your book of business to your top customer advocates  these data points will help you stay focused on the big picture and speak the language of the board. Read the full article  “4 Things Every CSM Should Know Off the Top of Their Head ( ) ” and ask yourself…how many of them could you present in a meeting right now? Also on the Success Network ( ) this week podcast-episode-8 ( ) Navigating the startup landscape takes more than just a great product — it requires mastering Customer Success at every stage.

"Welcome to all our new subscribers and a warm “Ahoy” to our loyal readers. Another major week in trade news  but the most significant event is the shift in the US political landscape. President Biden is facing major pressure from within the Democratic Party  while the Republican National Convention concluded with Trump formally accepting the GOP nomination for president. Let's dive in 🔭 **In today’s email:** * **Down We Go:**📉 Chip stocks plummet on US export restrictions. * **Holding On: **🍟 Why major western brands are losing market share in China.  * **Extended Chaos:**🚢 Maersk’s entire fleet impacted by Res Sea disruptions.  * **Shown The Door:**🚪 Insiders including Obama pressure Biden to exit.  ---------- ——————————————————————————— #### **TRADE NEWS   ** View image: ( format=auto onerror=redirect quality=80/uploads/asset/file/5e6bd264-34f5-4e79-bdef-1a2774aebcff/Article47.2.jpg?t=1721379279) Follow image link: ( Caption:  -------------------- ### **Chip Stocks Plummet Amid US Export Crackdown** Global semiconductor stocks experienced significant declines  with companies like ASML  Nvidia  and TSMC facing notable drops. This downturn was triggered by reports of potential tighter export restrictions from the U.S. and heightened geopolitical tensions. ASML’s shares in the Netherlands fell by 11%  while Japan's Tokyo Electron saw a 7.5% decrease. Other major players like Arm  AMD  Marvell  Qualcomm  and Broadcom also dropped over 7%. Bloomberg reported that the Biden administration is considering extensive regulations to restrict companies from exporting critical chipmaking equipment to China. Central to these potential restrictions is the [Foreign Direct Product Rule (FDPR)]( The FDPR grants the U.S. the authority to control the export of foreign-produced goods derived from U.S. technology. This means even if a product is manufactured outside the U.S. but incorporates American technology or software  it can still be subjected to U.S. export regulations. Originally introduced in 1959 and later expanded  the FDPR aims to prevent adversaries from leveraging U.S. technological advancements. Its impact extends beyond U.S. borders  affecting international companies that use American technology in their production processes. Despite ASML reporting better-than-expected earnings for Q2  its stock fell due to the potential risk of tighter restrictions  with 49% of its sales coming from China. ASML produces machines essential for manufacturing advanced chips. Former President Trump’s comments further negatively impacted semiconductor stocks. In a Bloomberg Businessweek interview  Trump suggested Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defense and claimed Taiwan took ""about 100%"" of America’s semiconductor business. These remarks cast doubt on the U.S. commitment to defend Taiwan if Trump were to become president again  particularly in the face of potential Chinese aggression. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. shares fell 2.4%  and U.S. chip stocks also suffered. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF dropped over 7%  with companies like Super Micro Computer and Applied Materials also seeing declines. -------------------- ——————————————————————————— #### ** TOGETHER WITH GRYPHON** ### Invest in The Future of Keeping Our Children Safe Online View image: ( format=auto onerror=redirect quality=80/uploads/asset/file/d58c9c46-9b3c-44ae-bd68-f0640655f652/Gryphon_Template.png?t=1719499785) Follow image link: ( Caption:  [Gryphon Online Security]( uses AI to make protecting your family online easy.

Trump Shines as Global Trade Watches** The effort to push Joe Biden out of the presidential race has intensified  with new reports suggesting he may [exit by the weekend]( The Washington Post reports that former President Barack Obama has told Biden’s allies that his chances of winning have dwindled  urging him to reconsider his candidacy against Donald Trump. Obama  who remains influential within the Democratic Party  reportedly believes Biden  at 81  should assess the viability of his campaign. This follows an Axios report indicating Biden is increasingly open to stepping aside  even questioning Vice President Kamala Harris's chances of defeating Trump. Biden’s resistance seems to be waning as more Democrats urge him to exit the race. Notably  influential figures like Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have privately advised Biden to drop out  believing his continued candidacy risks the party's prospects in the upcoming election. In stark contrast  Donald Trump is thriving on the campaign trail  bolstered by a heroic narrative and unwavering support. Throughout a [92-minute speech]( at the Republican National Convention  Trump recounted the harrowing attempt on his life  vividly describing how a bullet grazed his ear  coming within a quarter-inch of taking his life. Despite the near-fatal incident  Trump remained defiant  rallying the crowd with his tale of survival and resilience.

He honored volunteer [firefighter Corey Comperatore](  who was killed in the assassination attempt  and paid tribute to other brave individuals affected by the incident. Trump's poignant recounting of the event and his show of gratitude towards his supporters painted a picture of a candidate resilient in the face of adversity  further solidifying his position as a strong contender. Amid these domestic political dramas  the stakes extend beyond U.S. borders. The outcome of the election will influence global trade policies  affecting international markets and economies. Trump's America-first stance and Biden's contrasting global cooperation approach are pivotal to how trade relationships with key partners like China and the European Union will evolve. As Biden faces growing pressure from his party to step down  Trump’s dramatic resurgence following the assassination attempt has only amplified his momentum. Public appearances and heartfelt tributes have not only rallied his supporters but also underscored his enduring appeal. As Biden grapples with internal party conflicts and health concerns  Trump's narrative of survival and strength continues to shine  potentially reshaping the dynamics of the upcoming election and its impact on global trade. ——————————————————————————— #### **QUICK CLIPS ON “X” ** Tweet:  ( -------------------- ——————————————————————————— #### **SHIPWRECK OF THE WEEK **⚓️☠️ “Launched in 1979  the _**Zenobia**_ was a Swedish-built RO-RO ferry used for transporting vehicles and cargo.

"In today's newsletter  we will talk about: What edtech wants from Budget Unacademy is down  Byju’s is out  so who’s winning India’s education race? SaaS sector’s Budget wishlist Subsidies  lower tax on EV sector’s mind BYJU’S employees speed up job hunt Here’s your trivia for today: Who was the first person to climb all of the ""Seven Summits""? In-depth What edtech wants from Budget  Edtech companies are voicing their wishlist for the upcoming Budget. Their hopes include tax exemptions  enhanced digital infrastructure to bridge the access gap  and more to propel the sector’s growth. These measures  they argue  are crucial to democratise education  enhance learning outcomes  and equip the future workforce with necessary skills. Wishlist: Education sector stakeholders assert that the Budget should recognise the importance of aligning with the New Education Policy’s recommendations  including allocating 6% of total GDP to education. Prioritising teacher training and development programmes in the latest pedagogies and technologies is also crucial for delivering high-quality education  believes Prajodh Rajan of Lighthouse Learning. upGrad’s Mayank Kumar argues that the government should consider how it approaches ESOPs. He states that revisiting ESOP taxation policies could further incentivise talent retention and growth in the tech industry. Read More (  ) From the CapTable Unacademy is down  Byju’s is out  so who’s winning India’s education race?  The downward spiral of the country’s two biggest edtech players—Byju’s and Unacademy—hasn’t caused ripples in India’s edtech waters but a full-blown tsunami. One which has decimated the prospects of many of Byju’s and Unacademy’s edtech peers  sinking some altogether and leaving others fighting to keep their heads above water. While no edtech company has emerged as a clear winner—neither justifying the massive amounts raised nor truly revolutionising education in the country—they have collectively dragged the entire market down. This has made it more challenging for other players to win back the trust of the various stakeholders. This wave has washed investors away from Indian edtech’s shores and sent students and parents scurrying offline for their education needs. For the few edtechs that continue to swim against the tide  the need of the hour is to adapt and evolve to avoid being dragged under. Continue Reading (  ) Budget SaaS sector’s Budget wishlist  In a big push to embrace AI for technology startups in India  the government approved the IndiaAI Mission with a budget allocation of over Rs 10 000 crore in March this year. However  industry experts suggest that while this initiative is promising  more needs to be done to leverage the new technology across the sector. Demands: Several SaaS startups expect the upcoming Budget to focus on IP enforcement  streamlined patent processes  and incentives for R&D investments  says Vishal Puri  Co-founder  Spalba. “Recognising that small businesses are the backbone of our nation  the Budget should focus on accelerating the growth of startups and the MSME sector. Currently  publicly listed shares are taxed at 10%  while unlisted shares face a 20% tax ” says CleverTap's Anand Jain. Sandeep Agarwal  Global MD and CTO  Visionet believes the Budget should incentivise the establishment of Global Captive Centres (GCCs)  which can boost local employment and technological advancement. Read More (  ) In-depth Subsidies  lower tax on EV sector’s mind  Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s interim  pre-election Budget offered much-awaited support for EV charging infrastructure  especially on the manufacturing side. It also zoomed in on public EV infrastructure to boost the adoption of e-buses. With the full Budget 2024 now on the anvil under the newly-formed government  industry stakeholders have renewed their expectations for a new phase of the FAME scheme. Many asks: The EV industry’s biggest expectation from Budget is an advancement on the FAME scheme as the second iteration expired on March 31  2024. The scheme is expected to have a Budget outlay of around Rs 10 000 crore  the same as FAME II  according to two sources YourStory spoke with. It will continue to offer purchase subsidies on electric two- and three-wheelers. Beyond manufacturing and sales subsidies  EV players also reckon it would help if the government actively boosted usage  especially in commercial sectors. Read More (  ) Edtech BYJU’S employees speed up job hunt  Investor troubles  work culture  and industry decline have led many BYJU’S employees to depart  now with the NCLT admitting bankruptcy proceedings against the once edtech giant  remaining workers are stuck between a rock and a hard place. Jobs are tough to come by  and with the firm facing financial troubles  employees are unsure if their pending dues will be processed. Key takeaways: On July 16  the NCLT admitted a plea filed by the BCCI to initiate a corporate insolvency resolution process for Think and Learn Private Limited  the parent company of BYJU’S. At its peak  BYJU’S employed over 50 000 people  which has since nosedived and the current employee count is estimated to be around 7 000. Those with tech and product backgrounds have largely transitioned to new roles  however  employees in the larger sales domain are facing greater difficulty in finding new opportunities. Read More (  ) News and Updates Complaints: (  ) OpenAI whistleblowers have filed a complaint with the US SEC  calling for an investigation over the AI company's allegedly restrictive non-disclosure agreements. The AI company allegedly made employees sign agreements that required them to waive their federal rights to whistleblower compensation. Spike: (  ) Bitcoin price has topped $60 000 per bitcoin  up from lows of $53 000 earlier this month as Trump's chances of retaking the White House in November spiked on the crypto-based Polymarket prediction platform following an injury during an assassination attempt. Just robots: (  ) Roboticists at Yale University have developed a way for soft robots to replicate some of the more unsettling things that animals and insects can accomplish—say  a reptile self-amputating a limb  or ants building bridges by temporarily fusing their bodies. Did you know? Who was the first person to climb all of the ""Seven Summits""? Answer: Richard Bass. In 1983  he climbed the first six—Aconcagua (South America)  Denali (North America)  Kilimanjaro (Africa)  Mt Elbrus (Europe)  Mt Vinson (Antarctica)  and Mt Kosciuszko (Oceania/Australia)—in a single year. He completed the feat by climbing Mt Everest in 1985. We would love to hear from you!

I'm wondering about a hypothetical situation. Let's assume: Today we are sending a file with rates to the base  let's say it is Gdańsk -> Dakar for dry containers valid from August 1 to August 31. Hypothetically  this rate is updated tomorrow (the PSS charge appears and total rate is higher by 200USD than previously). The rate is valid from August 1 to August 31 as before. We send you a new file... and then what happens in the database  will we have two displayed rates for the Gdańsk -> Dakar search? Or does the rate sent later overwrite the previously uploaded one? Pozdrawiam / Best regards

How are you? I would like to ask you for 2 things:   1.  It would be important if we could have an option to show or not show the total in the end of the quotes  showing the total is not always good because this will change according to the cargo measures so is safe to us to not show I in quotes of LCL and AIR. Can we have a solution to that?   1.  We would like to know if is possible to have a raw excel file with all data of all quotes until today  with as much information as possible. Thank you

So many times  clients come to us looking for a way to make everything their CS team does more efficient. Some still use spreadsheets to track onboarding steps. Others can’t manage all their accounts. Others yet are stuck in a reactive loop and cannot find the necessary time to be proactive. By no fault of their own  mind you. SaaS is infinitely complex and there are NO SaaS companies that do everything right  by the book. It’s all part of a story I hear constantly. And more often than not  a customer success tool like Custify can help bring those processes into the present. That way  CSMs can refocus their attention on their customers instead of worrying about processes. When I started out in customer success some of the best

The company's decision to embrace cryptocurrency is seen as a forward-thinking move  reflecting the increasing acceptance of digital currencies in various sectors. Cryptocurrencies  such as Bitcoin  offer an alternative to traditional currencies  operating without centralized financial institutions. While advocates highlight the financial freedom and innovation they bring  cryptocurrencies are also known for their volatility and association with illegal activities due to the anonymity they provide. Ferrari plans to extend cryptocurrency transactions to other countries within its international dealer network by the end of 2024  where such transactions are legally accepted. This expansion marks a significant step in Ferrari's global strategy  aligning with the broader trend of incorporating digital currencies in mainstream business operations. -------------------- ——————————————————————————— #### ** TOGETHER WITH AEStudio** ### Your Brilliant Business Idea Just Got a New Best Friend  ### Your Brilliant Business Idea Just Got a New Best"

"If you work in the B2B industry  you’ve likely heard of ""the dark funnel"" — a shadowy pipeline of unattributed sales leads that lurk for a while before converting out of the blue. And it got us wondering: Is there a dark funnel equivalent on the post-sales side? ( ) Are there hidden-in-plain-sight revenue signals that Customer Success professionals could be leveraging for more expansion opportunities? We turned to three post-sales experts from the Vitally Success Network ( ) to weigh in: - Mark Stagi ( )   VP of CS at Avoma - Lauren Axworthy ( )   Founding Account Manager at Vitally - Emory Scott ( )   Senior Success Manager at POSH As Mark puts it: ""There are some hidden areas of revenue  for sure.

In today's newsletter  we will talk about: The AI way to networking The Great Indian discount broking bazaar: Will SEBI play spoilsport? Making recycling accessible and efficient A mega incubator for TN startups Upcycling plastic waste Here’s your trivia for today: Which finance minister presented the highest number of Union Budgets in independent India? Startup The AI way to networking  Building relationships can often be challenging whether you are a business owner or climbing the corporate ladder. Cold emails are usually left unread  messages are ignored on LinkedIn  and meetings most often end with a handshake. To solve this  Aakash Anand teamed up with Sumit Jha and Palash Arneja in 2023 and built Unikon.ai as an AI/ML-based peer-to-peer networking platform  to help users connect with advisors or professionals for advice  and enable experts to share knowledge and earn. Nice to meet you: The Gurugram startup focuses on making connections rewarding by enabling individuals who have “been there and done that” or “presently doing it” to offer advice. They can organise webinars or workshops and share expertise to earn income. The platform offers four main features: UniShorts  UniKonnect  UniSeek  and UniShows. Currently  the company operates in India and plans to launch in the US within three months. Read More (  ) From the CapTable The Great Indian discount broking bazaar: Will SEBI play spoilsport?  The growing popularity of investing has fuelled the country’s obsession with Futures & Options (F&Os)  a far riskier asset class. F&Os let traders quickly make big bucks by speculating on future stock price movements. Also known as derivatives trading  F&Os have seen such exponential growth in the country that the total value of contracts traded reached a staggering $1.1 trillion in March 2024  surging nearly 4 000% from ~$27 billion in March 2019. However  while derivatives bring in massive profits for active traders and also improves price discovery for regular retail investors  these contracts involve significant leverage and can amplify losses too. In fact  9 out of 10 derivative traders in India incur losses  according to SEBI’s findings. Key Takeaways: SEBI wants to slow down India's F&O market and has brought in a new regulation that will curb some revenue streams for brokerage platforms Discount brokers  which derive 80-85% of their revenues from F&O trades  which in turn  allows them to subsidise equity trades  will be hit more than full-service brokers SEBI’s move will now compel them to relook their deep discounting model and potentially lead to a rise in brokerage fees for investors Industry insiders say broker toplines could be hit even further than 50%  and some of the smaller and mid-sized ones might find it tough to survive Continue Reading (  ) Environment Making recycling accessible  efficient  India ranks among the top 10 countries globally in municipal solid waste (MSW) generation  producing over 62 million tonnes (MT) waste annually  according to a report by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI). However  only 43 MT of waste is collected  with 12 MT treated  while 31 MT is improperly discarded  posing significant environmental and public health risk. Founded in 2023  Delhi-based startup Scrapbuddy wants to change this by making recycling efficient and accessible. Go green: Initially bootstrapped with Rs 10 lakh from personal savings  the startup has recycled over one million kilograms of PET scrap in Delhi-NCR. Scrapbuddy offers a dual approach to waste collection through its website and mobile app. Users can schedule waste pickups at their doorstep for recyclable items  including plastic bottles  paper  polythene  cans  electronic items  vehicles  and old furniture. To ensure smooth operations  the startup has onboarded around 250 informal waste pickers across 80 segregation centers in Delhi-NCR. Read More (  ) Incubator A mega incubator for Tamil Nadu startups  The Tamil Nadu government plans to launch a mega incubator for startups focused on design  marketing and sales  said Sivarajah Ramanathan  Mission Director  Startup TN. Established in 2021  Startup TN is the state government’s initiative to foster innovation and entrepreneurship in Tamil Nadu and establish the requisite ecosystem within the state. Close ties: The state today has 8 952 startups  and the Tamil Nadu startup policy aims to take this number to over 15 000 by 2028. Addressing the challenge of income inequality in the country  Ramanathan highlighted the Tamil Nadu government’s efforts to promote inclusivity in the startup ecosystem through initiatives like SC/ST equity fund; funding for women entrepreneurs  self-help groups  micro-enterprises  and women-led startups; and funding for transgender and differently-abled people. He also spoke about the state government’s initiative to offer GST and incorporation support to enterprises and efforts to build startup hubs in cities such as Madurai  Thirunelveli  Cuddalore  Salem  Hosur  and Thanjavur. Read More (  ) Women entrepreneurs Upcycling plastic waste  From making inroads in the clean energy sector with biogas production in villages  Akansha Singh is now expanding her efforts to promote environmental preservation and upcycle single-use plastic through her venture  Swayambhu Innovative Solutions. Solutions to single-use plastic: Swayambhu has formed a group of ragpickers in Haridwar  Rishikesh and Delhi  and appointed an aggregator to collect mostly single-use plastic  such as the kind used to package milk and vegetables. The plastic is cleaned and sorted at Material Facilities Centres and processed into durable plastic sheets to manufacture various products  from benches to dustbins. Swayambhu provides employment to more than 100 ragpickers and employs 25 people at its factory in Haridwar. Read More (  ) News & Updates Quick fix: (  ) Microsoft has released a free tool to help people recover from the faulty CrowdStrike update that led to one of the biggest IT disasters to date. The tool is designed to enable IT admins to recover from the 'blue screen of death' boot loop that has left 8.5 million Windows machines out of action. Basic income: (  ) After three years of distributing $1 000 monthly to beneficiaries in Illinois and Texas  OpenResearch  a project backed by Sam Altman  found that recipients spend more to meet their basic needs and assist others  and don't drop out of the workforce—although they work slightly fewer hours. Closer look: (  ) The Competition Commission of India has reportedly sent nearly 100 queries to Reliance Industries and Walt Disney regarding their $8.5 billion merger of Indian media assets. The questions also include queries related to the details of sports rights  which increases the scrutiny of the deal. Did you know? Which finance minister presented the highest number of Union Budgets in independent India? Answer: Morarji Desai. He presented 10 Budgets  including an Interim Budget. We would love to hear from you!

This July  we're not just welcoming the height of summer but also a fresh wave of updates. Our mid-year release is packed with new features designed to refine your workflows and amplify your impact. Say goodbye to manual summaries and endless scrolling through account histories – CustifyAI handles it all for you. Our new AI Generated Customer Summary feature adds to our existing AI-generated playbooks  making it easy to gather and review customer details. It provides a complete summary of the entire account  ensuring smoother handovers and more efficient account management. Looking for a better way to collaborate with your customers? Our improved  Customer Portal now allows customers to update or add attribute values exportable via integrations or Playbooks. Plus  with Section Visibility Options you can create dynamic  personalized experiences based on attributes or tags making customer interactions more effective and tailored. And this is not all – keep scrolling 👇 to discover more exciting updates. Here's to soaring together this season  embracing growth  efficiency  and deeper customer connections with every update. NEW RELEASES 🔥 CUSTIFYAI AI Generated Customer Summary Have you ever been asked by your manager about the progress of a specific account? Do your CSMs need to write comprehensive summaries when handing over an account to another CSM? We are thrilled to introduce a new AI feature to complement our AI-generated playbooks: Customer Summary Generation. This beta feature is designed to help you effortlessly compile and review customer details  providing a comprehensive summary of the entire account. No more scrolling through account histories and manually writing summaries - CustifyAI handles it all for you! [  CUSTOMER PORTAL New Block - Form: Enhance collaboration by allowing customers to change or add values to different attributes  exportable to external destinations via Integrations or Playbooks. [ Build your form and have customers fill in information that will be immediately reflected in the attributes list in Custify.  Section Visibility Options: Control section visibility based on attributes or tags associated with the company. Options include:   * Always visible  * If company has tag  * Attribute-based visibility  * Hidden [  With section visibility  you can benefit from templates that dynamically change based on account information. For example  if a customer buys a specific add-on and that is reflected in an attribute or tag at the company level  a new section in the portal with instructions on how to use that feature can pop up. SEGMENTS We are excited to introduce new functionality to track attribute changes/movements  available for string  dropdown  and boolean attributes. You can now easily return lists of customers who had a plan change recently  or who have updated their contact information. This feature also allows you to identify customers who have switched subscription tiers  providing insights into user behavior and helping you tailor your engagement strategies more effectively. [ INSIGHTS We are pleased to announce new updates to our Dashboards and Reports  functionalities  designed to enhance data visualization and improve team performance tracking. Dashboards New Widget Type - Text: Add custom rich text areas to dashboards  including embedding videos. This feature lets you insert descriptive content to your dashboards  making them easy to understand by your team. [  New Widget Type - Financial Deals: Similar to the Company data/evolution widget this new widget returns various information about financial deals. Available functions include sum  average  minimum and maximum  count deals  and utilization. The widget works with financial deal attributes. The Restrict to company segments option allows you to filter by the segments that the company the financial deal is assigned to is part of. [  Reports Team Performance: Added meetings tracking to team performance reports  split between Organized (the user is the meeting organizer) and Participated. [  PRODUCT ENHACEMENTS 💪 CUSTOMER LIST VIEW Share views with specific roles: Control access by sharing views with selected roles or users. Go to Manage Views - Sharing and customize your views’ access. You can choose to share your views with everyone in Custify  or with specific user roles. [  Filter by Me in User fields: When filtering by a User type attribute (E.g. CSM Account Manager  etc.)  you can now select Me as an option. This will filter data to show only information relevant to the logged-in user. [  TASKS Due date filtering: Due date filtering has been improved  enabling quick filtering options such as past due  due today  etc.  while also retaining filtering by custom intervals. [ HEALTH SCORES Impact Based Scores: With this enhancement  any unavailable values in Health Scores that influence an Impact Based Health Score will be ignored. This ensures that the calculations accurately reflect the available data  providing more reliable insights into your organization's health metrics. [  SETTINGS Manage default Signals status: Control whether Signals for newly detected events are created as enabled or disabled by default. By default  they are set to enabled. [  Touchpoints calculation: Customize how the Last touchpoint attribute is calculated by allowing Events to influence it. You can select which events should impact the Last touchpoint metric.  [  Permissions:  * Manage settings: Split into multiple sub-permissions for more granular access    control.  * View Default Reports: Grant or restrict permissions to view Default Reports. [  Event-Attribute editor - User Type Attributes: Restrict assignable users within the editor for more controlled data management. This feature allows you to control which users can be assigned to specific user types (e.g.  who can be assigned as an Implementation Manager). By doing so  you can maintain a clean list of candidates when assigning roles. For example  when assigning an Implementation Manager in Company 360  you will only see people with the appropriate roles listed in the settings. [  GENERAL TFA - Remember this device: Our latest release introduces a convenient Remember this device feature designed to streamline your two-factor authentication experience. This functionality allows you to securely authenticate your device once  reducing the need for repeated verification steps in future login attempts. [  Explore All Updates [ THANKS

This step is intended to [circumvent Western sanctions]( imposed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The new law  effective from September  seeks to resolve significant payment delays with key trading partners like China  India  and the UAE. Central bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina  a strong advocate for the law  announced that the first cryptocurrency transactions are expected by the end of the year. The central bank plans to establish an ""experimental"" infrastructure for these payments  though specifics are still forthcoming. Anatoly Aksakov  head of the Duma  hailed this decision as a historic milestone for Russia’s financial sector. This legislation also includes regulations on cryptocurrency mining and the circulation of digital assets but maintains the ban on cryptocurrency payments within Russia. This approach mirrors actions taken by countries like Venezuela and Iran  which have turned to cryptocurrencies to mitigate the impact of international sanctions. Sanctions have caused considerable delays in international payments  severely impacting Russia's economy and contributing to an 8% decline in imports during the second quarter of 2024. Despite efforts to switch to trade partners' currencies and develop an alternative payment system within the BRICS alliance  many transactions still depend on dollars and euros via the SWIFT system. The World Bank highlights that this dependency exposes countries to significant financial risks amid geopolitical tensions. ""The risks of secondary sanctions have grown "" Nabiullina stated. ""They make payments for imports difficult  and that concerns a wide range of goods."" These complications have extended supply chains and increased costs  underscoring the necessity for a reliable alternative payment method. This legislative change aims to alleviate the economic difficulties posed by sanctions and ensure smoother international trade operations. -------------------- ——————————————————————————— #### **PRODUCT OF THE WEEK ** View image: ( format=auto onerror=redirect quality=80/uploads/asset/file/bbd61048-96de-4d6d-82cc-217f3df95dbf/unnamed-4.gif?t=1722506471) Follow image link: ( Caption:  ### **Meet the Most Advanced Wireless Earbuds Ever Created** Brooklyn-based [Status Audio]( changed the earbud game by packing three speakers inside each bud.

Customer Success leaders know that their efforts have a tremendous impact on the bottom line. They just can’t always prove it. Earlier this year  we asked 409 B2B Customer Success leaders ( ) to take a survey focused on how they measure the value of their work. We wanted to know which metrics CS teams are currently tracking and what’s preventing Customer Success organizations from effectively tying their activities to revenue. In other words: Who’s measuring what  and where are we falling short? You can read the full results of this survey in Vitally’s latest research report  The Revenue Mystery: Why Customer Success Leaders Struggle to Prove the Value of CS ( ) . Access the Report ( ) Vitally-Revenue-Mystery-Report-Email-Stat ( ) Key findings... - 45% of our survey respondents said that their job security is directly tied to their ability to prove the revenue impact of CS efforts. Unfortunately  28% of respondents reported that they are unable to do so. - Data accuracy is the #1 challenge that prevents CS leaders from tracking revenue-based metrics. 39% of our survey respondents say they have trouble deciding which efforts their team should prioritize due to a lack of data around revenue impact. - Despite the fact that Net Retention Revenue (NRR) was voted as the “most important” revenue metric by our respondents  73% did not know their company’s NRR for 2024 to date  and 38% didn’t know their overall NRR for 2023. The report also features actionable advice on how to better measure the revenue impact of your CS team  straight from our Success Network experts ( ) .

"In today's newsletter  we will talk about: A kinetic sand furniture maker The silent sibling: Riju Ravindran’s role in the Byju’s saga Delhivery swings to profit in Q1 FY25 Improving critical care with smart ICUs Inside Ola Electric's plans to cut losses Here’s your trivia for today: Which is the oldest surviving structure in New York City? Startup Inside kinetic sand furniture maker LUNOoOM  Sagar Agawane  robotics and electronics expert Vinay Sharma  and software engineer Angad Patil share a passion for blending traditional artistry with cutting-edge technology. Inspired by rangoli  the trio decided to feature it in a contemporary form and founded a lifestyle furniture startup LUNOoOM—an amalgamation of 'Luno' meaning moon and the resonant Indian sound 'Om'. Art: The Pune-based startup’s flagship product is an artistically designed table featuring kinetic sand—a play sand coated with silicone oil that holds its shape when squeezed or pressed. LUNOoOM  founded in 2023  features two main collections  the Signature Collection and the Earth Collection  with six SKUs and prices ranging from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 9 lakh. The bootstrapped startup is seeking strategic investment and plans to expand its product line by introducing flooring tiles  bar tops  office tables and dining tables. Read More (  ) From the CapTable The silent sibling: Riju Ravindran’s role in the Byju’s saga  ""Riju Ravindran never had a very active role [in Byju’s] since around 2012  when the company started hiring external employees. He was assigned to the finance department but wasn’t actively involved. He provided oversight and occasionally offered suggestions to his brother or the management. These suggestions were not given much importance due to his limited role in the company  though they would at least be discussed "" said a Byju’s employee who has been with the company for 15 years. Since 2020  Ravindran’s role in the company has diminished even further. This  however  hasn’t stopped Byju Raveendran from making full use of his younger brother by appointing him to several directorships across the edtech’s various subsidiaries in India and globally. These positions have allowed Ravindran to amass more wealth than many startup founders. Between 2015 and 2023  Ravindran sold shares worth $375 million in Think & Learn  the parent company of Byju’s  according to PrivateCircle Research. In 2022  Forbes pegged Ravindran’s wealth at $1.3 billion. This wealth  though  has come at a cost  with Ravindran often being used as a pawn to further the ambitions of his older brother. Key takeaways: Riju Ravindran  Byju Raveendran’s younger brother and co-founder of his embattled edtech firm  is unknown to most outsiders. Despite being a co-founder  Riju never had a defined role in the company  though he is believed to have previously overseen its finances. An introvert  he is notoriously media-shy  with no photos of him publicly available and the company also not using his face for press releases. His invisibility  though  has not prevented him from amassing close to $400 million from secondary share sales over the past decade. Continue Reading (  ) Logistics Delhivery swings to profit in Q1  Logistics company Delhivery had quite a lot of things to talk about in its post-earnings call on Friday. The IPO-bound startup swung to a profit in Q1 FY25  helped by higher revenue and a change in its method to calculate depreciation. Delhivery has also decided to provide dark stores and delivery services to quick commerce companies as it attempts to create new revenue streams. Scorecard: The company reported a profit after tax of Rs 54 crore in Q1 FY25  compared to a loss of Rs 89 crore a year ago. Delhivery also reported an increase in its EBITDA to Rs 97 crore in Q1 FY25 against an EBITDA loss of Rs 13 crore in Q1 FY24. Delhivery's dark store (  ) network will be for 2-4 hour deliveries and not for 15-20 minute ones  meaning it does not expect Zepto  Blinkit  and Swiggy's Instamart to become its customers  CEO Sahil Barua reportedly said in the post-earnings call with analysts. Read More (  ) Startup Improving critical care with smart ICUs  India has a massive shortage of trained ICU doctors (or intensivists) for a population of 1.4 billion. According to the ISCCM (a society of critical care medicine) report  there are more than 3 00 000 ICU beds across India  but only 5 000 intensivists manage these. To bridge the gap between the demand for high-quality critical care and the shortage of qualified intensivists  Dr Dhruv Joshi along with Dr Dileep Raman started Cloudphysician Healthcare in 2017. The full-stack AI and operations company partners with hospitals to handle patients in their ICUs and emergency departments. Expanding healthcare: Cloudphysician has partnered with over 200 hospitals across 23 states in India  including metros  Tier II  and Tier III cities. ​​It claims to have helped manage care for over one lakh ICU patients since its inception. The startup has developed a tech solution that makes high-quality ICU care available to patients anywhere in the country at any point in time. It does so by using its AI-enhanced platform ‘Radar’  which converts already installed hospital ICUs and emergency rooms into Smart ICUs. It works with over 200 hospitals in India  including some prominent hospitals like SGPGI in Lucknow  Motherhood Hospitals  HCG  and Cytecare. In the last year  Cloudphysician has expanded its hospital network by nearly 2.5x. Read More (  ) Electric Vehicles Inside Ola Electric's plans to cut losses  At an event  Bhavish Aggarwal  Founder and CEO of Ola Electric  laid down two themes that could help the company achieve profitability ahead of its IPO launch. Aggarwal said that the company is banking on high revenue and low costs as volumes rise. Eye at profitability: He added that the company’s 4680 Lithium ion cell manufactured in-house—which combines high energy density and high power density—would help significantly reduce the costs of manufacturing vehicles. The company will start delivering its motorbikes to customers early next year and integrate its new Lithium-ion cells beginning next year. Also  in the wake of MapmyIndia's lawsuit (  ) against Ola Electric for allegedly misappropriating its data  Aggarwal called the move “opportunistic”. A spokesperson called these allegations “false  malicious and misleading”.

You have a new mention from the Freightify workspace ( --- product-and-feature-launches View in the archives:  Belindra (8:11 PM  August 7th) We have an enhancement that will soon go live: *Multiple ports included in Quotations* *What’s New and Different?* Previously  when creating a quote with multiple rate cards  the quote and the PDF would only display a single origin/destination  even if multiple origins/destinations were involved. With this enhancement  if a quote is created with multiple rate cards  the PDF will now display all relevant origins/destinations. *Example:* - If we conduct a rate search for 2x1 and receive two different rate cards with different origins  both origins will be reflected in the Quote PDF. *Benefits for Customers:* This update ensures customers can see all relevant origins/destinations within their quotes  making the information more comprehensive and useful. Additionally  the Rate Refresh feature will reflect all included origins or destinations when clicked  providing up-to-date and accurate rate information within the quote. *Applicable Modes:* Currently  this enhancement applies to FCL on the UI for 3x3  10x1  and 1x10 configurations. *Requested By:* This enhancement was requested by Kerry Logistics. *Additional Information:* - Multiport search is not applicable for RPA Rates. - Applicable for Contract rates - This feature is also available in Rate Refresh within the Quote (when clicked  included origins or destinations will be reflected in the rate refresh option as well). - At present  multiple origins will be displayed within the specific quote and the PDF only. Multiple origins or destinations will _*not be showcased in the overall quotes module.*_ We will update in the same message when this enhancement is made live. Thank you

"This week  we’re taking a look at your offboarding process. Don’t worry - the review will be over soon  and you’ll want to thank me for the roughly 25% of churned customers you’ll be saving. Don’t believe me? Shawn from Referrizer used our SaaS to achieve just that. Here’s what he had to say about offboarding: ""You’d be surprised how much great feedback and customer insight you can get from exit interviews."" - Shawn from Referrizer So  you shouldn't have an offboarding process put in place that's just “click a button and you’re no longer a customer.” A more thought-out & refined offboarding process is the ideal solution to have your churned customers return. paragliding gif [ (2).gif]  That image may be a fun representation of customers jumping off your product yet it is also a surprisingly accurate metaphor. By letting them leave without a second thought  you’re essentially allowing them to jump off a cliff with no parachute to guide them. Here’s what you need to do:  1. Set up a system where cancellation requests go through an exit interview  2. Create an action plan for your most common churn reasons  3. Research canceled customers as much as you can before the exit interview  4. Determine what the problem is and follow your action plan during the call  5. Maintain a friendly and positive attitude focused on solving issues If you do all this  you’re not just giving your customers the metaphorical parachute  but you might actually be guiding them back towards doing business with you. You’ve got a complete analysis of what Referrizer did with this exact process on the Custify blog. The only requirement? A good customer success platform - and I think you know precisely what the best"

"No matter what CS looks like at your company  two of your biggest jobs as a leader will always be: 1. Delivering value to your customers 2. Proving the value of your team’s work internally The moment you attach revenue numbers to an activity  an initiative  a request — really anything — it gets people's attention. In her new article ( ) for the Vitally Success Network  Angeline Gavino ( ) breaks down four things she does at Katalon ( ) to help her CSMs stay focused on measurable business impact. Here's one of her tips on linking Customer Success metrics with revenue outcomes: “Your CRO isn’t going to care very much that 80% of customers are “green” right now. But what they will care about is if you can say  “We have $X in predicted renewal revenue from our healthiest accounts compared to only $X revenue on the line from red accounts. There's more closing potential and higher retention rates for green accounts  so we’re going to place our focus there for the next month.” If you're in a quota-carrying CS role or are struggling to advocate for the value of your Customer Success team  drop what you're doing and read this: How CS Leaders Can ""Speak the Language"" of Revenue to Prove Their Impact ( ) Also on the Success Network this week blueprint-procurify ( ) “Would you renew today?” It’s a simple question  but it can tell you so much ( ) . Asking customers if they would renew today opens the door for them to share their reasons for loving your product or not. It can serve as a nice prompt at the end of a CSM call  and provide the Customer Success team with important context they might not have received otherwise. In our latest Vitally Blueprint ( )   Procurify’s Tomas Williams ( )   shows how he uses Vitally Playbook Automation to gauge customer renewal sentiment early and at scale.

We wanted to know which metrics CS teams are currently tracking and what’s preventing Customer Success organizations from effectively tying their activities to revenue. vitally-revenue-report-email-stat-02 ( ) Key findings… - 45% of our survey respondents said that their job security is directly tied to their ability to prove the revenue impact of CS efforts — but 28% are unable to do so. - Data accuracy is the #1 challenge that prevents CS leaders from tracking revenue impact. 39% of our survey respondents say they have trouble deciding which efforts their team should prioritize due to a lack of data. - Despite the fact that Net Retention Revenue (NRR) was voted as the “most important” revenue metric by our respondents  73% did not know their company’s NRR for 2024 to date  and 38% didn’t know their overall NRR for 2023.

Amid the frenetic news of tech stocks  it is easy to miss out on the struggles of a legacy company—Warner Bros. Discovery. The US entertainment group has reported a quarterly net loss of $10 billion (  )   way more than Wall Street’s expectations of a $542 million loss and even more than its total revenue at $9.7 billion. Discovery and WarnerMedia had merged in 2022 to fight against the brutal streaming competition. But  going by its plummeting stock  which at one point hit a new low of $6.90 (  )   looks like the megamerger only delayed the inevitable. By contrast  Netflix India (  ) seems to have hit the right chords  both in terms of content and pricing. In the world of Indian startups  Brainbees Solutions  the parent company of omnichannel maternity and babycare platform FirstCry (  )   picked up pace after a slow start  with its IPO subscribed more than 12X on its third day. Moving on  AI wearable tech might be a hit only on paper. Case in point: the Humane AI Pin (  ) . The $700 gadget  which officially launched late last year with no great reviews to begin with  only sold some 10 000 units  of which 3 000 have been returned. In June  the company  led by ex-Apple designers  was looking for buyers  including HP. It is now reportedly negotiating with its current investors to raise debt. With Apple also scaling back its Vision Pro (  ) dreams due to poor demand  the hunt for the latest hot gadget is still on. Oh  but what apparently has a market  at least according to Italian fashion house Dolce and Gabbana  is a $100 perfume (  ) for dogs! The inspiration for the alcohol-free fragrance mist is Fefé  the pet dog of brand owner Domenico Dolce. ‘It’s a dog’s life’ just got a new meaning! In today’s newsletter  we will talk about Unicommerce IPO breaks records A pot full of lofty goals Pioneering the natural beauty market Here’s your trivia for today: What was the codename for the amphibious landings at Normandy during World War II?  News Unicommerce IPO breaks records  The public offering of Unicommerce saw remarkable interest from investors  becoming the most subscribed startup IPO yet in India this year. On the final day of bidding  the offer was subscribed 168.32 times  driven by strong demand from non-institutional and retail investors  shattering Awfis IPO's record of 108X subscriptions. Investor interest: The Unicommerce IPO  with a price band fixed at Rs 102 to Rs 108 apiece  saw greater interest from qualified institutional buyers on the third day of its bidding  with the portion getting subscribed 138.75X. As of 5:00 PM on August 8  the non-institutional investor category saw maximum interest with 96.9 crore bids  oversubscribing the 38 lakh shares on offer by 252.44 times. The Delhi-based SaaS company has secured Rs 124.5 crore from its anchor investors. Of the 1.15 crore equity shares offered at Rs 108 each  75.75% (87.29 lakh shares) have been allocated to eight domestic mutual funds across 10 different schemes.

In a crowded market where cloud kitchens including BiryaniByKilo  Behrouz Biryani  and EatFit are one-upping each other on foodtech platforms  Potful is now vying for the top spot above the rest. Beyond biryani: Operating 25 cloud kitchens across Bengaluru  Hyderabad and Chennai  Potful claims to be the largest handi biryani brand and the second-largest cloud kitchen brand in south India. From a revenue of Rs 5 crore in 2019  Potful reached Rs 70 crore in FY24  attained PAT profitability in June 2024 and became EBITDA positive in the previous quarter. Beyond running a cloud kitchen  the company also provides livelihood to over 100 potters from Chinnandahalli a village near Hoskote  Karnataka.

But it was her personal experience of growing up with sensitive skin that pushed Tuli towards opting for natural skincare products and discovering an opportunity in the market  for Soulflower. Focus on quality: Initially  Soulflower operated out of Bangkok  then moved production to India “for sustainability reasons”  manufacturing everything from aromatherapy products to healthy hair oil and natural soaps. During the pandemic  Soulflower pivoted to ecommerce  securing investment from Wipro and moving manufacturing to a farm in Rajasthan. The farm employs local tribals and women to promote sustainability and quality. Even as the wellness market has boomed unprecedentedly since the decade that Soulflower launched  moving forward with curiosity rather than fear has helped Soulflower carve out its own niche  Tuli says.

With this *Reset* button enhancement  it allows users to clear all pre-filled information with a single click. *Edit Load Type in Copy Quote:* Before when users copied a quote to create a new one  they couldn't modify the load type - meaning they could create quote only with existing load type that was in the original quote. With the new update  users now have the flexibility to *add or remove load types* during the copy process. This gives the users the ability to tailor each new quote to their specific needs  ensuring more accurate and relevant quotes. *Ports in Manage Sell Rates:* When setting up rules in the Manage Sell Rates section  users could only select the *origin* and *destination* fields under the Add Rule option. Users now have the ability to *enter a relevant port* when they specify a door in the origin field.

"Ola Electric has hit the ground running. The EV maker’s stock (  ) hit the upper 20% circuit on its stock market debut  despite a modest response to its public offering. The stock  which listed at a flat Rs 76 per share  closed at Rs 91.2 on the NSE  boosting the company's valuation to about $4.8 billion. Its founder Bhavish Aggarwal also doubled his wealth  according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index  giving the entrepreneur a net worth of $2.3 billion. The company’s stellar debut is indicative of the bankability of clean energy companies. Wind and solar energy solutions company Suzlon Energy’s market capitalisation crossed the Rs 1 lakh crore mark on Friday on the back of the acquisition of a wind turbine manufacturer. Moving on  AI may have the same influence Facebook once held in the 2010s. OpenAI assessed its GPT-4o model to have “medium risk” as its researchers found that some writing samples from GPT-4o could be better at swaying readers’ opinions than human-written text. While the mere mention of AI can cause mass hysteria  the technology is increasingly finding newer use cases. From JP Morgan Chase rolling out generative AI assistants for employees to help them with tasks like writing emails and reports  ISRO education students using the technology to facilitate innovation in the space sector  to India’s Supreme Court employing it for judicial translation and legal research—AI’s sphere of influence is getting wider. It’s even helping bring back the dead. AI projects (  ) around the world have created digital “resurrections” of individuals who have passed away. Lastly  we leave you with the story of a Bengaluru woman who became a delivery agent for a day (  ) and pointed out areas for improvement on X. It quickly caught the attention of Blinkit's top bosses  who made some improvements to the app. Now that’s called constructive criticism.

News Mamaearth parent ramps up strategy  Mamaearth’s parent company Honasa Consumer Limited is betting big on new-age consumer brands and personal care routines  all while cutting out the middleman to consumers. The house of brands clocked a 63% rise in net profit to Rs 40.26 crore in Q1 FY25  compared with Rs 24.7 crore during the comparable period last year  the filings with the BSE showed. Consumer-centric: The company  in the earnings call (  ) for the previous fiscal quarter  highlighted its plans to shift from a super stockist distribution model to direct distributors to expedite its omnichannel plans and tap on its multi-brand strategy. It also announced the discontinuation of its Ayurvedic Beauty Products brand Ayuga due to slow traction  and the launch of ‘Skin Renew by Dr. V’—a new premium brand under Derma Co.

In fact  technology can play an invaluable role in not only democratising access to resources that a community or population or an individual needs to thrive but also doing so in a culturally responsive way  believes Danielle Morris  Health Equity Lead  AWS Global Social Impact. Equitable access: Healthcare providers  hospital systems  and governments can use technology to host data to analyse in a way that allows them to understand if there are different needs of patients or certain populations  says Morris. She states that Gen AI has a tremendous potential to create efficiencies in healthcare systems  reducing the workload on care providers and hospitals so they spend less time on writing notes and documenting patient outcomes that can be translated easily through Gen AI. In 2021  in response to the pandemic  AWS launched its health equity initiative to democratise access to cloud technology for the healthcare sector  subsequently committing an additional $20 million in January this year.

This learning and her passion for music soon led her to start WeBhor in 2018  a Delhi-based NGO working towards creating social inclusion and learning through music. Tunes for thought: Through various programmes  WeBhor (We Rise Together) aims to create awareness and educate adolescent girls from marginalised and low-income communities about menstruation  sexual health  rights  and other taboo topics. The programme follows four modules which include body anatomy  gender  well-being and mental health  financial literacy  etc. So far  the NGO has worked with around 20 000 girls  however  breaking people’s stereotypical mindsets has been the biggest challenge  says Arya.

For Indian millennials  Cafe Coffee Day was where we had our “Friends” moments. Alas  today  it is mired in insolvency proceedings. Last week  the Bengaluru bench of the NCLT admitted the plea filed by IDBI Trusteeship Services  claiming a default of Rs 228.45 crore and appointed an interim resolution professional to take care of the operations of the debt-ridden company. Meanwhile  August's second week saw a dip in VC funding (  ) owing to fewer large-value transactions. Startups raised $134 million across 25 deals  compared to $332 million the previous week. Also  seeing a decline is the Indian smartwatch market (  ) . According to analyst firm IDC  shipment of wearables in India in Q2 declined 10% annually to 29.5 million units  largely pulled down by the smartwatches. It said smartwatch shipments in India declined by 27.4% YoY to 9.3 million units in Q2  down from nearly 12.8 million. Research firm Counterpoint agrees  as its analysis shows the Indian smartwatch market dipped by as much as 30% YoY. ICYMI: (  ) The legacy of Susan Wojcicki. Lastly  Banksy (  ) has appeared again  and this time  to cheer up the public in the midst of a gloomy news cycle. In the past week  London streets have been populated by a string of unusual animal sightings  including pelicans  a goat  and a trio of monkeys  courtesy of Banksy. Now  a big cat—poised and ready to pounce—has appeared on a bare wooden advertising hoarding! And  there’s more from where that came from! In today’s newsletter  we will talk about The tennis way of life An homage to an architect An actor’s love for sports Here’s your trivia for today: What is the proper title for a person who makes pizzas in a pizzeria?  Sports The tennis way of life  Abhijeet Muzumdar  Vice President and Head of India and Emerging Markets for Corporate Development and Amazon Smbhav Venture Fund  has seen success not just as a top corporate leader but also as a sportsperson. On the sidelines of the ITF Masters World Tennis Team Championship 2024  Muzumdar—competing in the men’s 40-plus category—spoke about the secret behind balancing professional dreams and pursuing his passion. Sportsmanship: He says  “Witnessing my interest in outdoor games  my parents encouraged me to channel my energy into formal sports. I developed an interest in playing tennis because my school had a public tennis court.” “My dedication continued to pay off as I earned numerous victories in state and national ranking championships across the U-12  U-14  and U-16 categories ” Muzumdar says. He adds  “Beyond my dedication to tennis and marathon training  I have a passion for mountaineering. I have trekked to Everest Base Camp and summited Mount Kilimanjaro.” Read More (  ) Wine and Food An homage to an architect  In the last few years  Jaipur has turned into one of the hottest destinations for food and beverages with an expanding repertoire of new-age restaurants and bars. The latest to join the list is The Swinton House. Its white facade would instantly remind one of the many significant landmarks in Pink City—from Rambagh Palace to Albert Hall Museum—designed by the prolific architect Sir Samuel Swinton Jacob in the pre-Independence era. An ode: Sagar Nagpal and Mohit Gurnani decided to reimagine the space by introducing modern elements while retaining its old-world charm. They also named the place The Swinton House in honour of the famed architect. The building where The Swinton House is cocooned is almost 150 years old. As one enters The Yard—the open courtyard-turned-dining area on the ground floor—the space pulsates with high energy and brings one back to the present era. Fermentation and house-made mixers are prioritised here  with the bar team focusing on creating their own fermented mixers—like tepache (a fermented pineapple drink) and tea concoction  which adds a unique touch to the Swinton House’s cocktails. Read More (  ) Interview An actor’s love for sports  In the last decade  actor Saiyami Kher has carved a niche for herself with her choice of roles in films and web series  including Choked  8AM Metro  and Faadu. But her portrayal of sportspersons in Ghoomer and the recent Sharmajee ki Beti seems true to her nature. She admits  “Sport has been a part of me since childhood. I can’t imagine my life without playing a sport. It is an integral part of my personality.” Real to reel: Kher is set to take her love for sports to the next level by participating in the upcoming Ironman triathlon in Berlin  Germany. Kher is the only female Bollywood star to participate in this race  and this honour has her feeling both excited and nervous. Actor Milind Soman is the only other actor from India to have done this. She was supposed to attempt the triathlon in 2020  but the pandemic struck and put her plans to rest. Back then  Kher was ready to take on the challenge after completing two full marathons and close to 20 half marathons.

The evolution of Indifi's digital lending DNA Pioneering the natural beauty market A pot full of lofty goals VC funding’s steady recovery Oh  and don’t forget to grab your tickets (  ) for the 15th edition of TechSparks Bengaluru  to be held on September 26-28! Here’s your trivia for today: What sport was reintroduced to the Olympics in 2016 after a 112-year absence?  In-depth Can Ola Maps take on Google?  Bhavish Aggarwal has been dangling many financial incentives for developers to use Ola Maps—including a year’s free access to Ola's navigation tech platform and free credits of over Rs 100 crore. Now his attention has moved to navigation tech to tackle the distinct challenges on Indian roads—by enhancing navigation in crowded areas  adding regional language support  and using India-specific algorithms. Long road ahead: “Mapping is a very intensive business. You just can’t create a great mapping service in a very short amount of time unless you put in a huge amount of meticulous effort ” opines Ashutosh Sharma  VP and Research Director at Forrester. While targeting the consumer market may not offer quick returns  focusing on a B2B strategy in Tier II and III cities could be a game-changer for Ola  notes Shivani Palepu  Principal Analyst  Gartner. In its early days yet  Ola has partnered with ISRO’s IRNSS programme to provide accurate GPS data  said sources familiar with the matter. Astrology platform Astro India AI and e-grocery delivery app KPN Fresh Product have also tapped into its services. Read More (  ) From the CapTable The evolution of Indifi's digital lending DNA  When Alok Mittal  Siddharth Mahanot  and Sundeep Sahi founded Indifi nearly a decade ago  the company only had 10 employees and focused largely on building technology. In fact  Sahi  who exited the company in 2017 to begin his own venture  was brought in as a technical co-founder by Mittal and Mahanot. Sahi was later replaced by Animesh Sharma  who continues to lead the technology vertical. “When you start a company  there is very little functional specialisation ” Mittal says. “For example  the tech guys were also doing product work  and the business development people were also doing sales. Then over time  the structure starts to change as you start hiring more specialists. We eventually separated the analytics function from the risk function  the product function from the technology one  and so on ” he adds. Today  after just over $90 million in funding raised from investors such as Accel  ICICI Venture  British International Investment  Omidyar Network India  and others  Indifi’s team has grown to over 900 employees  with a new CEO in place since last year.  View Org Chart (  ) Women Entrepreneurs Pioneering the natural beauty market  Natasha Tuli’s love for nature and everything organic has been a prominent fixture and a guiding principle in her life for years—from DIY summer projects on vermiculture  all the way to her plans for a career in landscape architecture. But it was her personal experience of growing up with sensitive skin that pushed Tuli towards opting for natural skincare products and discovering an opportunity in the market  for Soulflower. Focus on quality: Initially  Soulflower operated out of Bangkok  then moved production to India “for sustainability reasons”  manufacturing everything from aromatherapy products to healthy hair oil and natural soaps. During the pandemic  Soulflower pivoted to ecommerce  securing investment from Wipro and moving manufacturing to a farm in Rajasthan. The farm employs local tribals and women to promote sustainability and quality. Even as the wellness market has boomed unprecedentedly since the decade that Soulflower launched  moving forward with curiosity rather than fear has helped Soulflower carve out its own niche  Tuli says.

The Hindenburg haunting isn’t over yet. The US-based short-seller alleged that SEBI chief Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband Dhaval Buch had stakes in obscure offshore funds used in the Adani Group’s alleged money siphoning scandal.

SEBI also released a statement  advising investors to remain calm and exercise due diligence. The market regulator also asserted that it has completed 23 out of 24 investigations into the Adani Group.

Apply for Tech 30 (  ) From the CapTable RBI tightens grip on algorithmic credit models  With an exponential explosion of data sources—structured and unstructured  new and emerging—and multiple digital public pipelines to lean on  Indian lenders continue to find newer ways of assessing creditworthiness. That someone  with their digital footprint or otherwise  could be evaluated as being creditworthy  though  is something financial regulators rightfully worry about. Last week  the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) gave voice to these concerns. Through a draft circular  the central bank brought credit risk models of regulated entities under supervisory review and mandating a raft of changes aimed at holding the boards of lending entities responsible for the models these companies use. This move is critical given that in the next decade  the Indian market could rapidly evolve into one driven by digitally-led algo-credit models as newer datasets emerge as trustworthy and reliable.

She understood that sexual health still remained a taboo subject  and even if people overcame the “shame” associated with seeking help  they were not able to find the right doctor or treatment. This understanding led Mittal to start Qurex in 2023  a healthtech startup dedicated to sexual health solutions. Raising awareness: A person can book a 40-minute discovery call on Qurex  where they are connected to an in-house certified sex therapist who understands the root cause of the problem  based on which a treatment journey is recommended to the user on the same call. In a year  Qurex has collated data of close to 15 000 users  with 5 500 taking the root cause analysis call and over 1 700 people have completed their treatment journeys.

It saw a churn of senior executives at the company  with the e-commerce giant taking a completely new direction. One that CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy was previously adamant would never work out—quick commerce. “Flipkart  especially Kalyan (Krishnamurthy)  was never a believer in quick commerce. He was of the view that it was a balance between time and selection and quality which will work ” said a former senior executive at Flipkart aware of developments at the company. “This year  however  Flipkart Minutes  the company’s quick commerce initiative  has been the most high-priority project in Flipkart.” According to the executive quoted above and others The CapTable spoke with  Flipkart’s senior management changed its mind following the successful expansion by quick commerce players into categories beyond grocery—chiefly  electronics—which have been Flipkart’s forte. That they appear to be doing so profitably only added urgency to Flipkart’s response. “This is a very big threat to Flipkart ” said the former executive. Key takeaways: Despite being among the earliest to attempt hyperlocal delivery  Flipkart now trails rivals such as Blinkit and Zepto in the quick commerce race. However  the Walmart-backed company has ambitious plans for its quick commerce venture  Flipkart Minutes. It intends to offer a broader selection  better pricing  and superior user experience to users.

On his creative process  Kej says he uses technology to create an outline. “These days with the computer  you get amazing sounds which are extremely authentic—I cannot make out the difference between a real instrumental and a synthetic instrument ” he adds. According to the musician  AI will probably be the end of “boring and generic” music composers  but creative artists will find work.

Startup Giving EV batteries a second life  At the end of their lifecycle  some EV batteries are improperly disposed of  which can pollute the environment and harm plants  animals  and humans  while others are recycled. This is where the technology developed by BatX Energies comes in. The startup recycles lithium-ion batteries to mine critical minerals like lithium  cobalt  and nickel  which are then used to make new lithium batteries. Circular economy: BatX has developed an in-house proprietary process that produces black mass—a mixture of valuable metals  including lithium  cobalt  nickel  and manganese  produced while recycling used lithium batteries—with less than 1% impurities. The startup spends most of its capital sourcing used batteries  either from EVs or consumer electronics. It sources batteries from across the country as well as from Malaysia  the UK  Germany  and the Philippines. BatX is currently working towards bringing its higher-capacity hydrometallurgy plant live and expanding its black mass production capacity to 10 000 metric tonnes from the current 3 000 metric tonnes.

Made with love: TheCocoLove offers four variants of chocolate—Crunchel  filled with quinoa pops and cashews; Enchanted with cranberries and almonds; Fruition  packed with hazelnuts and raisins; and Velveto  filled with pure cocoa. The brand has an R&D facility in Mumbai and a manufacturing facility in Ratlam  Madhya Pradesh. It sources cocoa beans from Idukki  Kerala  and other ingredients from farms in northern India. It fulfilled around 5 500 orders in six months since January when it started selling its products. In the first quarter of 2024  it achieved sales of Rs 50 lakh. About 60% of its sales come from women.

It is built on OpenAI’s ChatGPT4 model. Local women from the community are validating the chatbot's response in terms of understanding and offering localised responses. This approach aligns with the human-in-the-loop strategy for accuracy and human empathy. “The bot responses are continuously monitored by medical professionals to mitigate any risks. This will soon also be supported by an automated system set up for real-time checking ” says Tanvi Divate  Lead and Director of the chatbot project.

"The future is green  or bust. The world is in a race against time to make this future a reality  amid rising temperatures  carbon dioxide emissions and fluctuating climates. The newest area of focus? Buildings. A research team at Columbia University has found a way to reduce energy consumption for cooling  with a zigzag structural wall design that can reduce a building’s surface temperature by up to 3℃ (  ) . Companies from Microsoft to Walmart are also embracing timber buildings as a way to cut down their carbon footprints. But  as Singapore’s $94 million wooden Gaia building is now discovering  even engineered wood is no match for an unexpected foe: mold (  ) .

Edtech PW to raise $150M round  Lightspeed Venture Partners is set to lead a $150-million funding round for Alakh Pandey's PhysicsWallah—a rare deal in India's edtech sector amid declining investor interest due to decreased demand for online learning. “PhysicsWallah had kickstarted exploring a fundraise last year and was looking at a slightly larger round of $250 million or so at a valuation of over $3 billion ” said one of the four people familiar with the matter. Capital infusion: Lightspeed  which has invested in edtech companies such as Bhanzu  Teachmint  and once India’s biggest unicorn BYJU’S  has issued a term sheet giving PhysicsWallah a pre-money valuation of $2.6 billion. If the deal goes through  PhysicsWallah will more than double its valuation from approximately $1.1 billion in 2022 to over $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion (post-money).

Many D2C food brands often face the challenge of inadequate understanding of customers  inconsistent brand identity  failure to differentiate  and the inability to attract repeat purchases. Rinka Banerjee realised there was a gap for R&D consultancy and teamed up with former colleagues Gourinandan Tonpe and Aditya Sapru to build Thinking Forks in 2014. The Bengaluru-based full-stack foodtech R&D consultancy firm helps startups build products from the ground up and brings their ideas to market. Key takeaways: Thinking Forks is equipped with in-house food labs and kitchens  along with a consumer interaction centre  where experts benchmark products against competitors through blind sensory tests. It has partnered with an AI firm to leverage the data generated in-house to accelerate product development  generate recipes based on specific requirements such as protein content and ingredient preferences  and digitise the R&D process. In the last two years  the company has experienced 2.5X growth in revenue and generates 50% of its turnover from international markets.

In today’s newsletter  we will talk about Decoding contra dating Activist Aruna Roy’s new book Social media’s viral ‘dadis’ Here’s your trivia for today: What body of water separates Australia and New Zealand?  Lifestyle Decoding contra dating  Opposites attract  or do they? The world of relationships has a new word: contra dating. As the term suggests  it is a trend wherein an individual dates someone outside their usual preferences  eventually stepping out of their comfort zone. “It’s a way to broaden your dating horizon  shake up dates that might have become routine  or even meet different people to understand your preferences better ” explains Ruchi Ruuh  a Delhi-based independent counselling psychologist. Love theory: Contra dating is a great way to break the routine and introduce an element of mystery and excitement back into dating  points out Ruuh. However  it’s important to ensure there is a similarity in values  ethics  and the foundational principles that make or break a relationship. Ruuh advises people to first understand what attracts them usually and why it isn’t working for them. Also  it may not be a good idea to go big too soon. Pushing oneself out of the comfort zone completely can lead to desperation and bad choices.

After a career in India’s civil service  which began in 1968  left her disillusioned  she moved to social activism. Today  Roy is one of the country’s most seasoned civil rights advocates and a repository of stories about change. Key takeaways: Her latest work  The Personal Is Political: An Activist Memoir comes as a profound exploration of activism from the inside out  backed by the collective experiences of the women and communities she has worked with. In 1974  Roy left the IAS to join the Social Work and Research Centre  a rural-development organisation in Tilonia in Rajasthan (founded by her husband Bunker Roy). About two decades later  Roy moved to Devdungri  also in Rajasthan  and set up the Workers and Peasants Strength Union (Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan; MKSS)  an organisation devoted to empowering workers and peasants and increasing the accountability of local governments.

In today's newsletter  we will talk about: Tête-à-tête with Ricky Kej Ajit Mohan on Snap’s India journey  being the underdog  and building in India for the world Giving EV batteries a second life Starting up at the age of 62 Ofbusiness’ public outing plans Oh  and don’t forget to grab your tickets (  ) for the 15th edition of TechSparks Bengaluru  to be held on September 26-28! Here’s your trivia for today: How many days does Tour de France last?  Interview Tête-à-tête with Ricky Kej  Three-time Grammy winner Ricky Kej has released an epic rendition of the Indian National Anthem. The endeavour has also set a Guinness World Record for being the largest-ever orchestra to perform the Indian National Anthem–a 14 000-member choir featuring children from tribal communities. In a chat with YS Life  Kej talks about his accomplishments  his creative process  and  of course  the elephant in the room—artificial intelligence and the fear of AI replacing people in creative fields. Timeless: The new rendition features prominent musicians Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia  Rakesh Chaurasia  Rahul Sharma  Sheik Mahaboob Subhani  Kaleeshabi Mehaboob  Jayanthi Kumaresh  Giridhar Udupa  Amaan Ali Bangash  and Ayaan Ali Bangash.

The phrase ‘once in a blue moon’ has never rung truer. Tonight  a rare super blue moon will be visible to skygazers. Compared with a regular full moon  a supermoon will be up to 30% brighter and up to 14% larger as the moon would be closest to Earth. But contrary to its name  it won’t actually appear blue. The colloquial expression originates from a 16th-century proverb: If they say the moon is blue  we must believe it is true. However  it didn’t stop the fervent human imagination from giving birth to myths. While people in some countries believed that wolves emerge on a blue moon  some others feared that if a person fell sick on a blue moon  they would pass away in eight days! This year  the super blue moon is coinciding with the Rakhi festival  which is expected to generate trade worth Rs 12 000 crore (  )   according to CAIT. Businesses are also tapping into the opportunity.
